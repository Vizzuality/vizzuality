Using vectors and SVG, for example, allowed us to implement zooming and panning, while moving the framework to D3.js gave us more options for visualisation."

Since the first internet browser was launched in 1991, there has been a rapid expansion in the number of browsers and the variety of features available. We wanted to take stock and make sense of all this innovation, the only way we know how: visualisation! Our friends at Hyperakt and Google Chrome felt the same way, so we worked together to create Evolution of the Web. After the warm reception of the first version, released in 2011, we made a new version using the latest visualisation technologies, including 3D effects, Canvas, CSS3 Transforms, SVG and D3.js. The result is a sumptuous, detailed and responsive visualisation that we're very proud of; we were honoured when TheFWA gave it Site of the Day back in August 2012.
