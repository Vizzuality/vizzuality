Working with Hyperakt and the Google Chrome team, we developed the interactive ‘Evolution of the Web’ visualisation. After the warm reception of the first version, we made a new version using the the latest visualisation technologies, including 3D effects, canvas, SVG and D3.js. The result is a sumptuous, detailed and responsive visualisation that won TheFWA Site of the Day.
