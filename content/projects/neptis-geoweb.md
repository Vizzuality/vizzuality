            title: Mix and Match Maps
            description: "At the heart of the tool is an interactive map where you can create custom maps from the huge range of economic, social and environmental data assembled by the Neptis Foundation. See how planned infrastructure development could affect protected areas and prime agricultural lands, or how population density has evolved in last few decades. We finished it with little details, like being able to change the transparency of each layer or automatically zooming to an area when certain local-scale layers are selected, to ensure a great experience."

            description: "The data are displayed in a number of different ways, taking inspiration from the various concerns people may relate to most strongly. On the map the data layers are arranged in an intuitive order and revealed progressively, so it's easy to find the information you need . People also feel a strong connection to certain places or certain themes, so we added Profiles and Topics pages to provide different hooks into the same data."

So you can customise your map and show the most important layers more prominently, we've added a feature allowing you to change the transparency of some of the layers. Try it out now and tell us what you think!

                    description: People care about places. Whether it's the great outdoors of the Greenbelt, their own backyard or where they work, spaces matter. To tap into this area of concern we've created profile pages where you can see all the key data, from population to the job market and types of dwellings.

Maps are crucial tools that allow people to view data and understand their world. When shown online, they can gain an added social element, with hundreds or thousands of people coming together to analyse and discuss key issues. The Neptis Foundation asked vizzuality to help them create the Geoweb tool, a place to unleash and facilitate discussion of a huge range of data about the Greater Toronto region. With a range of data on economic, social and environmental issues, and many different ways to look at the data, the tool should enrich ongoing conversations about the future of this area.
