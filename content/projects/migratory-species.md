Web technologies allow us to share complex geospatial information with a global audience, and allow them to explore it easily without needing huge technical understanding. We applied this to the Global Registry of Migratory Species, upgrading their Access-based database into PostGIS and adding new flourishes to their front end with Flash and other pixel rendering technology.
