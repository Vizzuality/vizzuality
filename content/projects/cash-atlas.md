        title: Only the data you need
        description: At higher zoom levels, the map would be very cluttered if you had all the data for the smallest level being shown. Progressive disclosure means the data shown is optimised for your current zoom level. And where you select one particular region for analysis, you can see the detail for one and summaries of the neighbouring regions to avoid distractions and allowing you to focus on your work.

        title: Evolving charts 
        description: Cash Atlas includes live visualisations to show the finer details of the data. As you explore the map, the charts change to reflect the new areas you’re interested in. You can also use the filters to ensure you’re only seeing the most relevant data.

The way donors respond to emergencies has changed; emergency cash transfers to affected people are increasingly used to respond to disasters. We worked with CaLP to develop the Cash Atlas, an interactive tool to explore who is donating, to which countries and for what causes.  Using open source tools like CartoDB and PHP Symfony2, we were able to provide users with a number of sophisticated analytical tools to explore the data, create live maps and visualisations and generate reports on the fly. Launched in 2013, it now has over 1000 registered users and covers 716 cash transfer programmes.
