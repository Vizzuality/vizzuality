All our staff at Vizzuality love the natural world and its cultural beauty, so admire the work being directed by UNESCO under the World Heritage Sites program. To give this important topic a better means of presentation, we decided to build a visualisation, using an early version of CartoDB. Using data from a number of different sources, like Wikipedia, Panoramio and the main list of World Heritage Sites, you can explore the world's most precious places from your desktop.
