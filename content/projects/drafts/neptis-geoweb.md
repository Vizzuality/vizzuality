Maps are crucial tools that allow people to understand their world. When shown online, they can gain an added social element, with hundreds or thousands of people coming together to analyse and discuss key issues. The Neptis Foundation asked vizzuality to help them create the Geoweb tool, a place to unleash and facilitate discussion of a huge range of data about the Greater Toronto region. With a range of data on economic, social and environmental issues, and many different ways to look at the data, the tool should enrich ongoing conversations about the future of this area.
