			title: "Mix and Match Maps"
			description: "At the heart of the tool is an interactive map where you can mix and match all kinds of layers about economic, social and environmental issues, from planned infrastructure development to protected areas and prime agricultural lands. We finished it with little details, like being able to change the transparency of each layer or automatically zooming to an area when certain local-scale layers are selected, to ensure a great experience."

			title: "Intelligent Information Architecture"
 			description: "The data are displayed in a number of different ways, taking inspiration from the various concerns people would relate to.  On the map, the data layers are arranged in an intuitive order and revealed progressively, so it's easy to find the information you need. People also feel a strong connection to certain places or certain themes, so we added Profiles and Topics pages to provide different hooks into the same data."

Maps are crucial tools that allow people to understand their world. When shown online, they can gain an added social element, with hundreds or thousands of people coming together to analyse and discuss key issues. The Neptis Foundation asked vizzuality to help them create the Geoweb tool, a place to unleash and facilitate discussion of a huge range of data about the Greater Toronto region. With a range of data on economic, social and environmental issues, and many different ways to look at the data, the tool should enrich ongoing conversations about the future of this area.
