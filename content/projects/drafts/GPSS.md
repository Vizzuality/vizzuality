        title: Dealing with heterogeneous data
        description: The datasets to be visualised are all very different, in terms of type and quality, and come from a number of different national and international sources. We built a flexible back end that was able to deal with this variety and serve accurate geospatial data to the front end. In the future we hope to add layers with other hazards at the global and local level and analysis capabilities.

Natural hazards can cause all kinds of damage to buildings and infrastructure. If a hazard hits a school there can be major implications for safety and for educational opportunities, hampering long-term performance and achievement of affected children. We were asked to develop a prototype for an open source mapping platform to monitor the resilience of all schools in the world to a variety of hazards. Using a beautiful, engaging design, users can navigate to look at data held related to schools in specific areas or aided by different project types.
