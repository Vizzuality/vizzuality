        title: A web tool for safe schools
        description: The datasets to be visualised are all very different, in terms of type and quality, and come from a number of different national and international sources. We built a flexible back end that was able to deal with this variety and serve accurate geospatial data to the front end. Using a beautiful, engaging design, users can navigate to look at data held related to schools in specific areas or aided by different project types.

Natural hazards can cause all kinds of damage to buildings and infrastructure. If a hazard hits a school there can be major implications for safety and for educational opportunities. The World Bank asked us to develop an open source mapping platform to raise awareness of the vulnerabilities to hazards and their accomplishments so far to make schools across the world more resilient. We used our experience in creating captivating visualisations of geospatial information to build a prototype tool.
