            title: Access all areas
            description: A dynamic city demands a dynamic dashboard. Featuring a powerful backend from CARTO and intuitive design by Hyperakt, the dashboard is fast and responsive on every device. At a glance, city employees can see what’s happening across the city and zoom in on specific locations or periods of time. Options to explore the data numerically, in charts, or in interactive maps offer deep insight that can be used to make timely, effective decisions. And, with its range of viewing options, each person can customise the dashboard so it’s set up perfectly for their day to day routine.

            title: Never miss a beat
            description: In a city that never sleeps, situations can arise and change fast. With this in mind, we made it easy for city employees to set up alerts that will ensure they never miss a thing. A few clicks is all that’s needed to set up email notifications that will be sent every time a specific indicator changes or passes a certain threshold. When information needs to be shared, that’s easy to do too—a simple press and hold on the relevant data will pop open a ready-to-send email.
