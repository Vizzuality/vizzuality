        title: The data you need
        description: "First we've brought together data on water, food security, conservation, climate change and much much more. But we know that if you want to truly understand these issues, and the interrelations between them, you need intuitive visualisations. With insights, dashboards and Planet Pulse, you've got multiple angles to analyse the data."

        description: "To reach the lofty Sustainable Development Goals agreed in September 2015, we need precise data to act in the right places at the right time. Moreover we need to share this data widely, using advances in machine learning, data processing and mobile phone ownership to give insights to the people on the frontline of social development and environmental protection."

The world's resources are becoming scarce; at the same time, we aren't providing enough for everyone to live well and prosper. We've teamed up with the World Resources Institute to build Resource Watch, an open platform for everyone to explore accurate, up-to-date insights about our planet. Anyone can create visualisations or apps using data from satellites, sensors and social media, to tell stories about the state of our planet. Then, with seamless sharing tools, show the world what you've learnt and inspire action.
