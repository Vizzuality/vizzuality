Madrid is a hub of science and culture, with thousands of works on display acrosss the city's museums and institutions making up a key part of the history of art and science. We worked with Institute of History (CCHS) at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) to create 101 Masterpieces, an open source online platform to guide people through the different storylines that play out through the centuries and across a number of the city's institutions.
