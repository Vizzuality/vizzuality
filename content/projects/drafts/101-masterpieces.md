Madrid is a hub of science and culture, with thousands of works on display acrosss the city's museums and institutions making up a key part of the history of art and science. We worked with the Institute of History (CCHS) at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) to create 101 Masterpieces, an open source online platform to guide people through the different storylines that play out through the centuries and across a number of the city's institutions. A scientific committee was formed to select the works, write summaries of each and create itineraries for specialised tours of the city.

Using Backbone and Leaflet Javascript we built a vivid visualisation to help you discover the history and culture of Madrid's masterpieces. With a highly customise Drupal distribution, content management is made easy.
