			description: "Throughout each journey you can choose to look at the data on the map. With a wide range of indicators to choose from, you can dig even deeper and see how the possession of different assets improves resilience or which shocks an area is most at risk from. Once you’ve found the data you want, you can download it, share it, or find out where the data came from."

Collating the world’s best data to inform decisions that enhance resilience to stressors and shocks in vulnerable areas of Africa and Asia. Working with Conservation International, we built an interactive tool that provides users with a deep understanding of the  resilience of specific systems (like livestock or agriculture) to changes in a range of parameters, such as precipitation, temperature or population. By using a combination of different javascript frameworks - like Leaflet and D3 - to create the interface, you can quickly and easily generate custom maps to share with the world. Finished with love by our expert engineers, the application achieves high performance, superb detail and ease of use.
