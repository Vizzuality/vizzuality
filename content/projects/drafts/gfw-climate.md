			description: "Each country has a dedicated page where you can quickly grasp the extent and direction of trends in deforestation, associated emissions and biomass. But we know that no two people are alike; everyone has different preferences for measuring these things. On each graph you can change the unit of measurement, the time range, % canopy density and the dataset shown for each indicator. When you have the data you want, the way you want it, you can save it, print it or share it!"

			description: "We also added a section where you can compare indicators for specific locations, whether that’s countries, jurisdictions or areas of interest like Protected Areas. It you ever wanted to see if Guatemala or Guyana are doing better at halting deforestation, or if Kenya’s Protected Areas are conserving more biomass than Tanzania’s, you can! With so many different types of people coming to use the tool, we wanted to give you as much flexibility as possible so you can get the data you need."

Find out the carbon cost of deforestation in different areas around the world. We’ve cherry-picked the most important data from the Global Forest Watch Platform and added brand new layers about carbon density and biomass, so you can easily analyse the climate impacts that result. We worked closely with our friends at the World Resources Institute to craft a number of new and fully interactive visualisations, so you can get the data you want, for the areas you care about, just the way you want it.
