        title: "Dealing with heterogeneous data"
        description: "The datasets to be visualised are all very different, in terms of type and quality, and come from a number of different national and international sources. We built a flexible back end that was able to deal with this variety and serve accurate geospatial data to the front end. In the future we hope to add layers with other hazards at the global and local level and analysis capabilities; the flexibility built into the back end makes this task much easier."

Natural hazards can cause serious damage to buildings and infrastructure. If a hazard hits a school there can be major implications for safety and educational opportunities, hampering long-term performance and achievement of affected children. The World Bank's Global Programme for Safer Schools asked us to develop a prototype open source mapping platform to monitor the resilience of all schools in the world to a variety of hazards. Using a beautiful, engaging design, users can navigate to look at data held related to schools in specific areas or aided by different project types.
