        title: Making it easy to assess species
        description: "We made intensive use of effects and animations to display the status of the tool, providing continuous feedback to the user as they make their assessment. And with unlimited undo and redo, all user actions can be undone and redone at any time, encouraging a trial-and-error analysis refinement."

The Red List of Species captures the threat level for the world’s species; it helps conservation experts in governments and NGOs to target actions to protect the most vulnerable species before they disappear forever. Putting together Red List assessments can take some time though and involves tonnes of spatial data. We built GeoCAT with Kew Gardens, ViBRANT and IUCN, to make this process easier and quicker. There is so much data out there on the web, from established biodiversity databases like GBIF to more citizen-oriented databases like iNaturalist and Flickr; GeoCAT neatly allows anyone to pull in this data, or upload their own data, and create an assessment quickly and easily. Since the first release we've continued to improve the experience through the EU BON project.
