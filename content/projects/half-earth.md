            title: Visualising biodiversity
            description: "Data collected by scientists, amateur naturalists, satellites and sensors are painting an increasingly detailed picture of our planet. We used React and a cartographic library called Cesium to create a virtual, interactive globe that can be spun, magnified and layered with data. The resulting visualisations are a beautiful way to discover where life exists, understand the pressure it’s under, and how it can be managed to achieve the goal of Half-Earth."

            title: Educate with delight
            description: "Presenting information in novel ways, like an interactive globe, opens up the possibility of learning something new, or gaining a fresh perspective on known facts. We believe it’s easier to inspire change when people feel joy, surprise and delight so every feature is designed to spark curiosity and engagement. As each person moves a toggle, selects a word, or spins the globe, they’ll bring data to life in a story that’s unique to them."

        title: “Unless humanity learns a great deal more about global biodiversity and moves quickly to protect it, we will soon lose most of the species composing life on Earth.”
        autor: E.O. Wilson

Earth is experiencing a biodiversity crisis. The rate at which species are going extinct is more than 1,000 times higher than it has ever been before. To save ourselves and the irreplaceable plants, animals and ecological systems we depend on, we must act now. 

We’ve been working with the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation to map the diversity of life on Earth and answer E.O Wilson’s call-to-action to commit half of the planet’s surface to nature. If we conserve half the Earth, we can safeguard the bulk of biodiversity from extinction. By mapping available species data at 1km resolution globally, we’re identifying the places that contain the greatest diversity of life and the rarest of species, and informing decisions on which half to protect.
