There are over 7000 languages across the world, nearly 35% of which have less than 50,000 speakers. Efforts to preserve these languages, and the unique perspective on the world that is built up around each one, needed a new tool to help researchers, citizens and communities record, document and store pieces of these languages. What resulted was Endangered Languages, a website allowing you to view the world through 3000 lenses and contribute your linguistic knowledge to the conservation efforts.
