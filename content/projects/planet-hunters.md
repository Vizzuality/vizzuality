Billions of people around the world look up to the stars at night; so do NASA’s telescopes, satellites and probes. Analysing all that data is difficult, and machines are often not very good at finding the distinct patterns that signify planets orbiting stars. Using a combination of powerful visualisation libraries, we were able to bring to life our vision for a user-friendly, interactive and above all beautiful tool that unleashes the scientist in all of us. 

Planet Hunters puts data from NASA’s Kepler mission right at your fingertips so you can help in the hunt for life out there in the stars. Wonder, delight and science all in one: a signature Vizzuality product.
