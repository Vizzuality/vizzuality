        title: Rewarding Humans...
        description: "The human eye is often mightier than the computer; recognising patterns in hand writing is second nature to us, but sometimes extremely difficult for computers. To get hundreds or thousands of people to lend their eyes and pattern recognition talents, we needed to build a rewarding experience. The beautiful visualisations and the social recognition of efforts keep people on board."

The great maritime explorers of the last few centuries are long gone, but their observations live on in the yellowing pages of their log books. By digitising these records, climate scientists around the world have access to a more complete picture of the climate hundreds of years ago, so they can better predict what will happen at this crucial phase in human history. Old Weather uses the unique human skills of pattern recognition and detection to recover weather records from our past, which are used to understand our future. It combines an elegant interface, a unique social element and the power of the crowd to create a rewarding experience for every user.
