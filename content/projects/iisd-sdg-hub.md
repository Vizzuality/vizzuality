            title: Fast, dynamic searches
            description:  "With more than 30,000 content items to explore, it’s essential that they can be filtered quickly to find the most relevant information. The filter bar on the news page provides extremely specific filter options. Although this means it’s harder to keep the Javascript and AJAX functionality simple, some careful query building and the use of specific caching meant we were able to build a site that is fast and maintains full functionality."

            title: Visual cues
            description:  "On the homepage, we’ve taken the circular symbol of the SDGs and extended each segment of it by a varying length, to visualise the scale of just how much has been written about each of the SDGs. When a segment is selected, information pops up with details of how many articles, policy briefs and events associated with that goal are available."

As the world negotiated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it was always acknowledged that everyone would have to work together if the global community wanted to turn its high ambitions into action. With this in mind, IISD challenged us to help them develop a new knowledge hub where everything they had published on sustainable development over the past eight years could be viewed. 

We knew we needed to build something that piques curiosity at every turn and helps people to find the links between each of the SDGs. It had to be a space for people to find new information that inspires new actions, a place that hastens rather than hinders collaboration. Working together, IISD built the back end as we designed and developed the front end to make sure all the content can be accessed quickly and easily.
