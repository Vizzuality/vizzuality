        title: Data for Development
        description: NGOs need accurate, up-to-date data so they can plan new activities, coordinate existing work and report on what they’ve done. With NGO Aid Map you can quickly find out which activities are happening in a particular sector or geographic area.

        title: Data when you need it 
        description: We wanted to remove as much of the burden as possible involved in finding, entering or updating data, making the process quick and easy. This is especially important when trying to mobilise emergency responses, and NGO Aid Map was used in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and recently in the Horn of Africa.

Over the last few decades, the amount and variety of development activities across the world has increased, and it’s sometimes difficult to keep track of all of the varied actions and activities. Especially in times of acute crisis, like the aftermath of the Haiti Earthquake in January 2010, access to information on which NGOs are providing services in certain locations can drastically improve the efficiency and effectiveness of relief efforts. With NGO Aid Map, we focussed on simplicity and flexibility to ensure users could get to the data they need as soon as possible. From Argentina to Zimbabwe, you can map it, filter it, download it and use it to change the world.
