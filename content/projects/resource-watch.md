            title: The data you need
            description: "We've brought together data on water, food security, conservation, climate change, deforestation and much much more for you to play with, explore and analyse. But we know that if you want to truly understand these issues, and the interrelations between them, you need powerful and intuitive visualisations. We've given you multiple angles to analyse the data, from dashboards and maps to innovative features like 'Insights' and 'Planet Pulse'."

The world's resources are becoming scarce; at the same time, we aren't providing enough for everyone to live well and prosper. We've teamed up with the World Resources Institute to build Resource Watch, an open platform for everyone to explore accurate, up-to-date insights about our planet. Anyone can create visualisations or apps using data from satellites, sensors and social media, to tell stories about the state of our planet. Then, with seamless sharing tools, show the world what you've learnt and inspire action.
