            title: The data you need
            description: "We've brought together data on water, food security, conservation, climate change, deforestation and much much more for you to play with, explore and analyse. But we know that if you want to truly understand these issues, and the interrelations between them, you need powerful and intuitive visualisations. Especially when you consider the volume of data, we wanted to create new design patterns that empower people all over the world to understand and tell stories with the data. We've given you multiple angles to analyse the data, from dashboards and maps to innovative features like 'Insights' and 'Planet Pulse'."

            description: "To reach the lofty Sustainable Development Goals agreed in September 2015, we need precise data to act in the right places at the right time. Moreover we need to share this data widely, using advances in machine learning, data processing and mobile phone ownership to give insights to the people on the frontline of social development and environmental protection."

The world's resources are becoming scarce; at the same time, we aren't providing enough for everyone to live well and prosper. We've teamed up with the World Resources Institute to build Resource Watch, an open platform for everyone to explore accurate, up-to-date insights about our planet. Anyone can create visualisations or apps using data from satellites, sensors and social media, to tell stories about the state of our planet. Then, with seamless sharing tools, show the world what you've learnt and inspire action.
