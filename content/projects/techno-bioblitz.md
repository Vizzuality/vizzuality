Back in 2010 we built a series of tools to support a bioblitz in the Woods Hole area of Massachusetts, during a meeting of the Biodiversity Information Standards TDWG. The point of a bioblitz is to get the public to explore their local natural beauty, at the same time as gathering observations of the species in the area. With a little sprinkle of Vizzuality magic, we built some tools to help analyse and tag photos as well as creating a simple website to let participants get involved.
