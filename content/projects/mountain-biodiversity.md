Mountains are extreme locations that harbor a huge variety of species depending on altitude, soils and other conditions. We built a web tool for the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment that simplifies the process of downloading specific data for biodiversity analysis. This required a mix of PostgreSQL to handle queries, custom Java software for raster tile layering and Pixel Bender Technology for the front end filtering tools, to deliver a responsive and intuitive experience.
