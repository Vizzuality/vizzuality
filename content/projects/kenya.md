Live feeds of information straight from satellites to an SMS or smartphone, direct to the world’s poorest farmers. Beginning this April we embark on a joint research project with the Zeitz Foundation to explore how we help small scale farmers in Kenya improve their food productivity. Important work, beautifully crafted; it’s what Vizzuality are all about.

For the next growing season, smallholders in Kenya will be getting text messages from satellites to help them play with and adopt new, productive, sustainable farming methods. We’ll be working with farmers, building technology with a combination of cartodb, twilio and a little vizzuality magic to build a pioneering prototype that demonstrates the potential of this idea. We want to excite the world with the possibilities of using big data in small packages to deliver sustainable livelihoods.
