        description: Led by our design chief Sergio Estella, the first step the team takes is to put together drawings and mock-ups that show what the visualisation could look like. We then test the sketches with different stakeholders to see how they react and refine them based on feedback

Google Trends has been used as a social barometer over the last few years, revealing patterns in our behaviour based on what we search for. We used this over the 2014-2015 season to see the changes in team popularity and fan loyalty. Our team utilised a number of cutting-edge front-end tools in new ways (e.g. using d3 to integrate animated maps on SVG) to create dynamic maps that respond to screen size in order to deliver the best viewing experience.
