We then test the sketches with different stakeholders to see how they react and refine them based on feedback.'

Google Trends has been used as a social barometer over the last few years, revealing patterns in our behaviour based on what we search for. We used this over the 2014-2015 season to see the changes in team popularity and fan loyalty. Our team utilised a number of cutting-edge front-end tools in new ways (e.g. using d3 to integrate animated maps on SVG) to create dynamic maps that respond to screen size in order to deliver the best viewing experience.
