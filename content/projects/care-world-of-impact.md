            description: "We were given a range of excellent datasets by CARE, each with a different temporal dimension and format. Donation data, for example, were points with daily timestamps while the impact data was served as times with a monthly stamp. To ensure a consistent and enjoyable experience, we pushed the rendering performance of softwares like Carto and XX. Building on our experience with [http://vizzuality.com/projects/global-forest-watch](Global Forest Watch), we also wanted to build a timeslider to control the animation as well as filtering the data shown. We used XX and YY to achieve this."

There is no greater power than when millions of people come together behind a vision and act to change the world. To celebrate 70 years of helping people in their hour of greatest need, CARE asked us to build an interactive web application that showcases a ‘World of Impact.’

The result is a living record of the donations being made to CARE and the places where that money is creating lasting impact. Built on Redux and React, with a sprinkle of Leaflet, Carto and D3, anyone can quickly see what, where and how they're donations are changing the world.
