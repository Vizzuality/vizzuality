Every year hundreds of scientists and tourists visit Antarctica; field guides are an essential part of the planning, to help them understand where they will find certain species. Working with the SCAR-MarBIN and ANTABIF we were able to put together the Antarctic Field Guides to generate these important documents on-the-fly. It pulls in information from multiple sources for each guide and can be published or downloaded as a high quality pdf. We put this together purely in HTML5 and javascript, pushing forward a bunch of new techniques for fast, interactive map tools on the web.
