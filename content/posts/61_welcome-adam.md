We are pleased to add another developer to our Cambridge cohort: [Adam
Mulligan](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/adam_mulligan). Adam joins as a
front-end developer, and has a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from
Royal Holloway. Since graduating he’s been working with the UN
Environment Programme on a whole host of projects, gaining a deep love
for Javascript, Ruby, PostgreSQL and pub lunches on Fridays.  He’s also
a founding member of the Cambridge Ruby User Group.

Adam is a hardware hacker as well. He recently got his hands on one of
the university’s vinyl cutter and made this lovely sticker, while also
gaining an embarrassingly strong interest in mechanical keyboards. Look
out for wood-based cartography in the coming weeks! When he’s not
hacking away at tech you’ll probably find him playing the latest release
of Goat Simulator or cleaning the streets of Berlin in Street Cleaner
Simulator 2015.
