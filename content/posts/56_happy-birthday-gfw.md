When I joined Vizzuality a few months ago, one of the first things I was tasked with was to look into the analytics for [Global Forest Watch](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/globalforestwatch) and see what I could find out about how it is used by different people across the world. As we celebrate the first anniversary of GFW’s official release in February 2014, I thought it would be interesting to look back and see what we have learned about our users over the last year.

Let me first take you back to the start, and why we even bother with user analytics. At Vizzuality we take a great deal of time to sculpt a product. We want to deliver a memorable, remarkable user experience. To do that we use personas, descriptions of a type of user and how they will interact with the product. This guides the development of certain features: simply put, when you know who is going to click a button, and why they want to click that button, you can make sure that button is placed in the right location and labelled appropriately.  

Once a website has launched, we usually revisit these personas and make sure that users behave in the way we expected. Analytics software, like Google Analytics, helps us to look into things like user demographics, how many times certain pages are looked at and the journey of a user from landing to exiting GFW.

In all, users have spent over 1205 days looking at GFW since its launch in February 2014, and these are some of the things we’ve learned about those users.

-   25% of sessions were from users in the USA, almost 10x more sessions than the entire African continent
-   The younger the user group, the more even the gender balance; of users over the age of 35, around 70% are male
-   ⅓ of mobile users are in the 25-34 age group, but 70% of tablet users are over 45
-   Sunday is the most popular day for mobile and tablet users to visit GFW, while Friday is the most popular day for desktop users
-   Over half of the people using the analysis feature are 25-34 year olds from just 5 countries: USA, Indonesia, Colombia, Brazil and the UK.

There are two specific findings that were especially useful to help us build new features. Take country pages for example. They’re a relatively under-used part of the site (only 3.5% of total time spent on the site was looking at these pages) but each page is predominantly visited by users from that country or from Europe, North America and Australia (dubbed EAA in the graph below). Visitors from neighbouring countries (‘in sub-region’) and countries outside EAA make up a small proportion of visitors to a country page. With this information, our design team could target the navigation to the country pages more effectively in our latest release of GFW.

The second is the huge amount of time the average user spent not looking at the key content that can help track forest extent: the maps, countries and stories pages. I estimated that the ratio of time spent looking at ‘content’ to ‘non-content’ was around 1:1.5; so for every minute spent looking at a map or a story, a user would spend another minute and a half not looking at the data. On the ‘non-content’ side, I saw that 35% of total time on the site was devoted to the homepage, 7% on the ‘Accept Terms’ page (which you saw on the first visit to the site) and 1.5% on the ‘Unsupported Browser’ error page. This compares with 24% of user time spent on the maps pages, 3.5% on the country pages and 1% on the stories pages. Time spent on other pages was a further 25% of total time on GFW.

This insight, coupled with conversations with users, helped us to learn about how GFW is used and suggest refinements to the structure and navigation. After months of designing, testing and refining we released the new GFW to the world in January this year, and so far the changes have helped to reduce the ratio between content time and non-content time to 1:1.34. We will continue monitoring the analytics with our friends at WRI, always learning and looking for ways to make GFW even better; [if you want to get involved, why not get in touch?](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/about/contact-us)
