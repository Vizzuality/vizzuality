We are pleased to announce another new starter in our Madrid office, with [Gerardo Pacheco](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/gerardo_pacheco) joining our front-end engineers. Hailing from the era when MSN groups were cool, he knew from that early exposure to coding that a life in front of a screen was the life for him. Gerardo has a degree in Computer Applications Development from I.E.S Comercio and years of experience building client-side applications in Javascript, Backbone, Underscore, HTML5, CSS3, SASS and server side services in NodeJS and MongoDB.

A native of Caracas (Venezuela), Gerardo moved to Madrid 7 years ago. He also loves to go to [movie premieres](http://www.geriux.com/events-photography/) and take pictures in his spare time. He is happily settled in the sunny city and looks forward to learning and building in the future.
