Open Data
=========

We want to share a remarkable step for the open data movement in Spain.
Based on the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Spanish government
unveils today a new transparency law for a more open government. 

Following there’s a quote for the English edition of Madrid-based
daily [El
País](http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/03/22/inenglish/1332436828_249953.html): "The
Cabinet on Friday will approve a far-reaching government transparency
law that will give citizens full access to official documents and
records, and enforce open government policies at all public agencies to
break open the tradition of secrecy in Spanish bureaucracy".

According to El Pais, three-pronged proposal of the new transparency law
covers public contracts, right to information and good governance. Spain
is the only EU country with over one million inhabitants with no access
to information law. 

Research shows that over one in two requests (54%) never gets any kind
of response, while only 20% receive the information requested, according
to [Access Info Europe](http://www.access-info.org/), which recently
launched a new site
called [tuderechoasaber.es](http://tuderechoasaber.es/) following the
success of projects
like [whatdotheyknow.com](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/). Users can
make and track requests for information from Spanish public bodies.
