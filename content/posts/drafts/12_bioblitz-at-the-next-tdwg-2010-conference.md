Bioblitz at the next TDWG 2010 conference
=========================================

![](http://www.tdwg.org/fileadmin/template/main/tdwg01/images/logo.gif)This
year at TDWG 2010 Annual Conference in Woods Hole, there is a new event
going on. We are organizing a
[Techno/Bioblitz](http://www.tdwg.org/conference2010/)! 

For those who dont know what a Techno/Bioblitz is, first of all is not
some sort of new music style. It is a event where we invite everybody to
discover an area, Woods Hole, going to the field and collecting or
observing biodiversity. The technical people, for example us, we will be
working on tools and methodologies to help on the data gathering
process, the sharing of the data and finally its visualization.

Vizzuality is contributing by helping to organize the technical side,
aka the “Techno”. Specifically we are working on the use of Fusion
Tables for data storage, Taxonomy  resolution services, validation
services, visualization of data and maybe, another data gathering tool.
If you want to join us on organizing the event, or want to contribute
with software, [subscribe to this mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/tdwg-bioblitz).

On the other hand Javier is also chairing what promise to be a very
interesting session on Hardware and Infrastructure. There will be talks
on big Biodiversity projects and Cloud Computing. 

Finally Vizzuality will likely be giving a computer demonstration of
latest projects and might participate on some Lighting talks on data
visualization.

Looking forward to meet the community at TDWG and have a great Bioblitz.
