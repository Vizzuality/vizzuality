GastoPublico just released for Desafio Abredatos!!!!
====================================================

We are thrilled to release our new website gastopublico.es after
48-hours of extreme hard work. We are more than proud of the result, the
design, the cuantity and cuality of data is amazing.  Even if we have
been not been able to develop all services we wanted to do still there
is so much interesting information that you can search for, comment and
vizzualize….

One of the most difficult side has been the scraping of the public web
site. Contrataciondelestado.es is one of the most difficult databases to
scrap. 

Another problem has been the need to understand the specialized glossary
for public procurement (I am afraid I dont know the names in english but
a good way to understand our difficulties could be to watch this video
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZBY7rIOrNg>)

But we’ve not only had problems, we have enjoyed many other moments..and
the proof is in eating the pudding (spanish translate: y para muestra un
boton): <http://www.flickr.com/photos/jatorre/sets/72157623758617921/>

We don want to extend any more, we are going to celebrate it!!!
