abredatos 2010. A 48-hour competition to develop software applications based on public data
===========================================================================================

We are very excited to announce that Vizzuality is going to participate
this weekend in [abredatos](http://www.abredatos.es/), a new way to
develop web applications based on public data. This initiative is the
first one to happen in Spain, following the initiatives from New York
City BigApps in the US and showusabetterway in UK.

Abredatos is having already a great success in the community. There are
currently more than 45 teams willing to compete. If you also have a good
idea, you’d better hurry up, the deadline to participate finishes on
Friday 16th April at 12:00 AM.

Vizzuality is going to show its work under the gastopublico.es (public
expenses in English). The web based application will present procurement
information related to public construction geolocalized, so that anybody
can see the public works being done in its surrounding area.

Vizzuality truly believes in active participation of citizens,
gastopublico.es will not only be a way to show more transparency on
public data, but also to retrieve feedback by the citizens, the real
payers of the constructions. The new web will use wikipedia,
[voota](http://voota.es/) and other participative services to improve
public data.

Vizzuality wishes good luck to all participants!
