Old Weather: Our Weather's Past, the Climate's Future 
======================================================

![](http://www.vizzuality.com/images/projects_images/OldWeather/oldweather5.jpg)

We are very proud to announce that one of the projects where we have
been working on is now released. Its name is [Old
Weather](http://oldweather.org/) and is one of the most interesting
project we think we have done so far. Go and check it out.

In essence, the idea is to to ask everybody to help digitizing log book
from old boats so that we can learn how the weather was in the past. A
log book is the daily diary that all boats have. On them they wrote,
among other things, measurements of the weather conditions together with
location. That brings the possibility to know what the weather was like
100 years ago on the ocean and try to understand how it has changed
since then.

The project also includes the idea of “Games with a purpose”. People
should have fun while digitizing. In Old Weather you can become a
sailor, and by digitizing become a captain. The idea that you are only
10 pages away to promote to a new position is very engaging!

Old Weather is catching up in the media. You can find articles on TV,
Radio and Internet. Check out for example the
[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11532534) or
[Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/old-weather/), plus
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#search?q=oldweather). With some [great
videos explaining the
project](http://www.oldweather.org/how_to_take_part), Zooniverse knows
how to promote their projects. It is very exciting to be part of it.

Vizzuality has worked on the Visual Design and frontend programing. We
had a great time working with the good people from Zooniverse and we
look forward to work on them on future exciting projects like this one.
We have a[page now on our website describing the
project](http://vizzuality.com/projects/oldweather).

Meanwhile I think we have already 3 captains at Vizzuality, go digitize
some books and become a captain yourself!
