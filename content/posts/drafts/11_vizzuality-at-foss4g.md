announced some months as we are sponsoring this year [FOSS4G in
Barcelona](http://2010.foss4g.org/). Now it will happen next week!. We
are very excited to participate on the conference and contribute as much
as we can to the community.

Specifically for those from the Biodiversity Informatics and
Conservation community, we are trying to organize a Breakout session to
discuss the use of Open Source GIS for our projects. We hope to have a
fun session where we can all learn about each other.
