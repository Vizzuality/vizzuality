Open Source CartoSet announced at FOSS4G in Denver
==================================================

This week half the team is at the Free and Open Source Software for
Geospatial [FOSS4G](http://2011.foss4g.org/) conference in
Denver. Yesterday, Wednesday was the first day of the sessions and
[Javier de la Torre](https://twitter.com/jatorre/) presented
[CartoSet: a new FOSS to create highly visual geo
portals](http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/cartoset-new-foss-create-highly-visual-geo-portals).
Check out his presentation (soon the sound will also be published):

  

The announcement was well received and lot of
[Tweets](https://twitter.com/#!/search/cartoset) and
[blogs](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/open_source_cartoset_makes_beautiful_maps_fast_eas.php)
started to appear.

The source code for the framework is available at GitHub and we look
forward for anybody interested in collaborating with us on the
development.

Today we will be announcing CartoDB, the Open Source Geospatial Database
on the Cloud we have been working hard on, but this deserves another
post in itself :)
