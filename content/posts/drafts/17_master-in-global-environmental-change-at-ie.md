Master in Global Environmental Change at IE University
======================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfut8272bT1qabv21.gif)Here at
Vizzuality, we have always had a close connection to the academic world,
as many of our [clients](http://vizzuality.com/clients) are universities
or research institutes. The [IE
University](http://www.ie.edu/university/) in Madrid, for example, are
among our frequent collaborators.  

Most recently, we’ve been working with [Professor Jacob Van
Etten](http://www.ie.edu/IE/site/php/es/school_biology_detail.php?id_academic=398),
dean of the Faculty of Biology, to prepare the [Master in Global
Environmental
Change](http://master-in-global-environmental-change.ie.edu/).  Now the
fun part: Sergio and Javier, together with [Andrew
Hill](http://biodiversity.colorado.edu/), will be instructing a class
for the masters, *Data Management and Information Design*. 

The course will cover concepts, skills, and methods we use at Vizzuality
to perform data analysis, processing, and visualization. Much of the
material will involve geographic data and the use of maps.  The course
is meant to teach professionals to turn data into information,
information into insight, and then leverage insight to make a better
world.

We’ve arranged several fantastic guest instructors for the course, such
as [Jon Hutton](http://www.unep-wcmc.org/staff/jonh.htm), Director of
the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre and [Damon
Stanwell-Smith,](http://www.unep-wcmc.org/aboutWCMC/dsp/dynamicstaff.aspx?id=130&Damon_Stanwell-Smith)
also from UNEP-WCMC and working on Biodiversity Indicators. On the
technical side of things, we’re supported by
[Geocommons](http://geocommons.com/), providers of the mapping platform
we will be using for coursework.

You can learn more about the classes on the [course
wiki](https://github.com/andrewxhill/DMID/wiki). Soon we will also begin
publishing the presentations and additional content. Also check out the
[class blog](http://mgec.tumblr.com/), where students will be posting
everything developed during the class.  Keep an eye on those students,
too — at the end of the master, one will join Vizzuality for an
internship!
