NEEMO, crowd sourcing a seafloor biodiversity identification
============================================================

This week we helped launch a new project on [Zooniverse
Labs](https://www.zooniverse.org/lab "Zooniverse Labs"), called
[NEEMO](https://neemo.zooniverse.org "NEEMO Project"). For 13 days NASA
astronauts, scientists and technicians on a mission called
[NEEMO-15](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/NEEMO15/index.html "NEEOM-15"),
where they will be living in an underwater habitat called Aquarius to
research marine life and prepare explorers for missions to far-off
planetary destinations. During these missions, NASA collects thousands
of images of underwater life and features. They need your help to
analyze those images and help us guide the scientists on their
excursions around the habitat!

NEEMO is a collaborative, spatial annotation, application built using
Node.js. It allows users to race one another to identify and annotate
seafloor biodiversity quickly and accurately. NEEMO is all about seeing
how we can quickly build accurate sets of spatial annotations using
crowd sourcing. [The race is
on](https://neemo.zooniverse.org/ranking.html "NEEMO Scores")! Using
socket.io, NEEMO allows users to see and validate each other’s findings
in real-time and all of the annotations are being stored, tracked, and
served using [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com "CartoDB").

After only the first few days of collecting data, we have thousands of
identifications and thousands more validations. We are really excited
about it, keep the annotations coming NEEMOers!
