We are delighted to announce the arrival of our latest intern to the Vizzuality family. Paula Haertel studies International Media and Computing at the University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, and will be with us until February 2016. Paula has taught herself the basics of a number of software languages over the last 2.5 years including HTML, CSS, some jQuery, Django, Python, Java and Swift. Weâ€™re hoping to help Paula work on these skills (particularly front end languages) and get to grips with the whole software development process during the 6 months in Spain. 

In return, Paula will teach us all about long complicated German words (like Quetschtoastmaschine), making pinhole cameras from juice cartons and how to dance to electro and techno. She was also looking forward to running round the streets of Madrid until she realised how many hills there were.
