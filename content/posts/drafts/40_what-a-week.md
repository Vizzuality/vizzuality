What a week!
============

These are exciting days at Vizzuality. In the last two weeks we’ve
launched some of the biggest projects we’ve been involved so far, the
[Endangered Languages Project](http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/) and
the [Evolution of the Web](http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/)
visualization. And we’ve received great feedback. 

The Endangered Languages Project, a collaborative tool developed to
facilitate the work of linguists and volunteers documenting endangered
languages, has received coverage from hundreds of publications worldwide
like
[CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/21/tech/web/google-fights-save-language-mashable/),
[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/endangered-languages-project-google-wants-to-save-3000-languages-under-threat-thanks-partly-to-google/)
and
[Mashable.](http://mashable.com/2012/06/21/google-org-fights-to-save-3054-languages/) It
was also linked at Google’s home page. We are learning a lot about
scalability this week. I think our team deserves a badge for “I
developed an app that was on the Google home page and it did not go down
and responded in less than 150ms”. A little bit long for a t-shirt, but
quite a story!

These are images from Google.com, Google France and Google Hong Kong,
but we were all around the globe:

yesterday, Google’s senior VP of Chrome and Apps, Sundar Pichai, showed
our latest project [Evolution of the
Web](http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/) in his keynote presentation at
[Google I/O 2012](https://developers.google.com/events/io/)Developer’s
Conference held in San Francisco. It is really impressive to see our
work in such a huge screen and with thousands of people looking at it.

This is a photo taken from the live video streaming of the conference:

We will explain in a future post the details of this visualization of
the history and pace of innovation in web browsers –we developed it for
Google in collaboration with our friends at
[Hyperakt](http://hyperakt.com/). Meanwhile, we wanted to share with you
the images above.

What a week!
