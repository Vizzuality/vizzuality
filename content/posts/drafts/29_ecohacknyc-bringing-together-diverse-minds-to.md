EcoHackNYC, bringing together diverse minds to solve challenging problems
=========================================================================

At Vizzuality, we are passionate about biodiversity and the natural
world. That is why we do what we do. Over the past few years we have
made an attempt to work almost entirely on projects that we felt could
have a positive impact. Working with amazing teams from
[GBIF](http://vizzuality.com/projects/wdpagbif "GBIF WDPA") to
[botanical
gardens](http://vizzuality.com/projects/rlat "GeoCAT") and from
[Google](http://vizzuality.com/projects/imazon "Imazon") to
[NASA](http://vizzuality.com/projects/neemo "NEEMO") has given us the
opportunity to interact with some really amazing people: scientists,
engineers, designers, and librarians. Each time, we are humbled and
amazed by what these people can accomplish.

Now, we want to share that with you! 

With the help of our sponsors and friends, we are organizing an
unconference called,
[EcoHackNYC](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/ "EcoHackNYC"), on November 4th
and 5th at NYU. The purpose of EcoHackNYC is to bring together diverse
minds to tackle real global environmental change problems dealing with
data analysis, information access, communication, and data
visualization. We are already so impressed by the reception from the
community. 

From our end, we are working with [REDD
Metrics](http://www.reddmetrics.com/ "REDD Metrics"), [Brighter
Planet](http://brighterplanet.com/ "Brighter Planet"), the [Citizen
Cyperscience
Centre](http://www.citizencyberscience.net/ "Citizen Cyberscience Centre"),
the [Shuttleworth
Foundation](http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/ "Shuttleworth Foundation"),
and [NYU](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/ "NYU ITP") to make a really fun event.
More amazing though, some world-class scientists, developers, designers,
writers and others have already signed up to give their time freely to
environmental and global change projects we haven’t even announced yet!
 It is these passionate people that we were excited to see come together
in the same room. More than that, it is exciting to bring together
people and communities that otherwise may not have the opportunity to
work with one another. It is the synthesis of the diverse communities
that we think could lead to some powerful results.

The event is going to be held at NYU in coordination with friends in the
[ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/ "ITP") department. We are less than two
weeks away, so get involved,
[sign-up](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/ "EcoHackNYC"), submit a project,
let us know you are interested from afar, tweet
[\#EcoHackNYC](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23EcoHackNYC "#EcoHackNYC ")!
