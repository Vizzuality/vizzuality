The Old Weather project is complete - 1.6 Million new observations
==================================================================

The [Old Weather Project](http://www.oldweather.org/), a citizen science
initiative by [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), has reached its
goal: all the logbooks from 280 World War I Royal Navy ships have been
read and transcribed in their entirety. This means over 1 million, six
hundred thousand new weather observations have been recovered resulting
in an amazing treasure trove of information. Congratulations to the
entire [community of volunteers](http://forum.oldweather.org/), [project
partners](http://www.oldweather.org/about) and everybody who has been
following it.

Vizzuality built the project’s site, a [collaborative
tool](http://vizzuality.com/projects/oldweather) to help online
volunteers transcribe the handwritten pages; containing one of the
earliest and most systematic collections of climate data across the
oceans. Where the computers failed, volunteers have carefully annotated
the digitized logs.

This is an image of the tool used to read the photographed logs online
and transcribe its content:

This body of work, compiled by a virtual army of volunteers, will help
scientist and researchers build a more accurate picture of how the
climate has changed. The records also contain ample historical data and
stories that will permit historians to track ship movements and
understand the circumstances of the people on board. 

“We’ve got the weather records, and richer and more detailed and
extensive historical infomation than we expected, but we’ve got much
more than that: we’ve grown an amazing community of project
participants, and we’ve planted the seeds for several other projects
with similar aims”, reads [the
post](http://blog.oldweather.org/2012/07/23/one-million-six-hundred-thousand-new-observations/) on
the milestone published at the Old Weather blog. 

Here at Vizzuality we are very excited to have helped building this
community that collected all this data.  OldWeather is one of the
projects that best defines Vizzuality, in its goals and in the way it’s
been executed. Over the next couple of months you will see another
similar project, this time working with Biodiversity data,  lets hope it
is as successful as OldWeather.

A new dataset for climatologist is created! Today our inner science
geeks and the environmentalist we have inside is overwhelmed with joy.
