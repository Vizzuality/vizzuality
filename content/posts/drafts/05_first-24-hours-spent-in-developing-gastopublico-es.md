First 24 hours spent in developing GastoPublico.es
==================================================

The middle of the time has gone and we have already experienced several
adventures during this short time.

There have been several issues along the day we would like to point
out:- First of all, we are increasingly reducing the number of
functionalities as the time goes by and we foresee that it is not
possible to finish it on time (I hope we are not the only abredatos team
that are encountering this problem…). - Javi discovered that Google
Fusion Tables is still too much beta and was having serious interface
problems so he had to get back to SQL and has delayed him several hours
(and that is a big percentage of time in abredatos!)- Sergio had to
redesign the home several times and we are still not sure how to
implement the participation service of the project- That some people are
following our code from the repository almost at realtime!- That
everybody is going out at the time we are coming back to the office
after dinner…

…but even after all this issues, we are really motivated and are looking
forward to continuing our adventure!!\
\
FYI: Next post will be just after www.gastopublico.es will be released.

Enjoy!
