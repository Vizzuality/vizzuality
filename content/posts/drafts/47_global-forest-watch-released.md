Global Forest Watch released!
=============================

Reposted from [blog.cartodb.com](http://blog.cartodb.com)

Today we are excited to announce the launch of the [Global Forest
Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/ "Global Forest Watch") (GFW), a
dynamic online forest monitoring system that brings together
near-real-time deforestation data, interactive mapping and analysis
tools, and geospatial subscription services to monitor deforestation
alerts in areas around the world. We developed GFW as part of a
multiyear collaboration of over 40 partners led by [World Resources
Institute](http://www.wri.org/ "World Resources Institute") (WRI).

We are happy to see this important work released to the public. GFW will
allow anyone in the world to visually explore the latest known
deforestation activity coming from the worlds best sources. The platform
unites data visualization, big data, crowd sourcing, and environmental
monitoring, subjects that are all core to the
[Vizzuality](http://www.vizzuality.com/ "Vizzuality") mission. The
platform is meant to empower everyone from government policy makers
looking for comprehensive on data recent deforestation to indigenous
communities who have a stake in the preservation of their local forests.

The technology behind GFW is [open
source](https://github.com/vizzuality/gfw) with many of the data
visualizations, graphs, and maps being powered by
[CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/). Even the temporal visualizations share
technology with CartoDB’s [Torque
library](http://blog.cartodb.com/post/67674300140/beautiful-maps-with-torque "Torque").
Finding innovative ways to visualize large-scale deforestation data in
the browser has been particularly interesting for us and has been a fun
area for development that we are proud to now have available now for
public use.

As part of the GFW project, we worked closely with WRI’s new
[DataLab](http://datalab.wri.org/). We see the DataLab as an innovative
way forward for WRI and a model for other non-profits and foundations to
study. The DataLab is bringing together a team of big data thinkers and
software engineers with advanced knowledge of global change issues. The
DataLab is already allowing WRI to move quickly in areas that are
otherwise difficult to enter without these cross-domain thinkers.

6GFW and the DataLab represent a step into the future for global change
monitoring. We are grateful for having the opportunity to collaborate on
such an important project.
