Vizzuality at CERN
==================

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/CERN_logo.svg/200px-CERN_logo.svg.png)

What a week for Vizzuality! We were invited to give a seminar on data
visualization and citizen science at
[CERN](http://public.web.cern.ch/public/), in Geneva. Sergio and I are
both big physics enthusiasts, so visiting the renowned science center —
whose [mission](http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/About/About-en.html)
is “finding out what the Universe is made of and how it works” — was an
awesome experience. Of course, we wouldn’t expect anything less from the
creators of the [Large Hadron
Collider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider).

To top it all off, we were hosted by the very department that [launched
the WWW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Www#History) and is currently
building a [huge GRID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHC_Computing_Grid).

We were actually invited to CERN by Francois Grey and Daniel Lombraña,
who are working on many interesting initiatives related to citizen
science and volunteer computing. We first met Daniel when he dropped by
our Madrid office for coffee, and we were immediately impressed by the
projects he showed us. It turns out that his research overlaps — both
thematically and technically — with much of our recent work, so it’s
been great to be in contact with his group.

Our talk*, New trends in data analysis and visualization on the web*,
was well-received. The abstract we sent must have been enticing — as our
presentation began, the seminar room filled until people were standing
in the back! Sergio was a bit nervous at first, but quickly warmed up.
We got a lot of questions and began several really interesting
discussions that continued through the lunch break.

You can view the presentation
[here](http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=121591), or
check out the slides on
[Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/jatorre/new-trends-in-data-analysis-and-visualization-on-the-web).
Keep in mind that we were advised not to get too technical, so the talk
provides more of an inspirational overview rather than revelations on
technology. Nonetheless, we hope it gives you some insight into what
we’ve been up to recently. 

We look forward to working further with Francois, Daniel, and their
team… and seeing the LHC next time we visit them!
