Knight helps us advance map based storytelling
==============================================

Yesterday, Knight Foundation [announced that
Vizzuality](http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/1/22/testable-moment-for-media-innovation/)
has received a \$35,000 grant to help build an open source tool for
journalists that will enable better storytelling with maps online. We
have long been advocates of creating data driven stories and this grant
will allow us to help make it easier for everyone. As part of the
[Prototype Fund](http://www.knightfoundation.org/prototype/), our
project aims to simplify the process of combining narratives, maps,
transitions, and interactions into a single web page.

<span></span>We are excited about the process and know that we will
learn a lot along the way. The project will give us the opportunity to
test and explore how newsrooms and independent journalists see
interactive maps fitting into the stories they tell. It will let us dig
deep into the how maps can enhance news stories and how text and
multimedia can enhance maps. In the process, we will develop an
experimental new library for combining maps and other content on the
web. The library will be useful for both newsrooms and individuals
trying to use maps in interesting ways.

Vizzuality and CartoDB join a group of 23 other projects working to
explore new approaches to delivering information to the public. On our
end, we will be collaborating with journalists to isolate and simplify
some of the key online mapping techniques that help enrich and support
digital stories. We are excited to get members of the journalism
community involved. You can follow and take part in the development
process on our [Odyssey.js GitHub
page](https://github.com/CartoDB/odyssey.js) or follow updates here on
our blog.

If you are interested in the Knight Prototype Fund, applications for the
next round of grants is [due January
31st](http://www.knightfoundation.org/prototype/).
