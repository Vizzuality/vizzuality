'PH1', the first confirmed planet discovered by Planet Hunters
==============================================================

[Planet Hunters](http://www.planethunters.org/), a project by
[Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), announced this week the
discovery of the first confirmed planet found by the citizen science
initiative. The planet is labelled ‘Planet Hunters 1′, or PH1. There’s
full info about the discovery on the
project's [blog](http://blog.planethunters.org/).  

We developed the [online
tool](http://vizzuality.com/projects/planethunters) to help amateur
astronomers sieve through data taken by the NASA Kepler space mission
and search for new planets. These huge amount of data consist of
brightness measurements, or “light curves”, taken every thirty minutes
for more than 150,000 stars. Participants can use the online tool to
search for possible transit events.

The logic behind the project relies on the pattern recognition abilities
of the human brain. Planet Hunter participants may outperform computers
at finding signals in this type of data. 

The online tool allows them to review and annotate the images. A minimum
of three separate observed transits are needed as well as follow-up
observations to confirm a possible candidate as a new planet.

PH1 has been confirmed by astronomers in Yale. It is a [circumbinary
planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumbinary_planet) (it orbits two
stars instead of one) that is about 3,200 light-years from Earth. As of
October 15, 2012, there are sixteen confirmed systems of circumbinary
planets. The discovery has been a true [team
effort](http://blog.planethunters.org/2012/10/15/planet-hunterss-first-circumbinary-planet-a-true-team-effort/) and
has received wide press coverage by publications like
[Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/10/planet-hunters-four-star/),
[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19950923) and
[NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/10/15/162952704/citizen-scientists-discover-a-strange-planet-in-four-star-system). 

“Anyone viewing the sky from PH1 would have a spectacular view of all
four stars”, as it is described in the Planet Hunters blog. “More
importantly, this amazing system will help us understand how and where
planets can form –producing a stable planet in a system where four
different stars are moving about can’t be easy." 

Here there is a list of other Planet Hunters
[candidates](http://www.planethunters.org/candidates). Congrats to the
Planet Hunter team for this amazing discovery!
