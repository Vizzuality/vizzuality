Every morning I walk the back streets of Cambridge to the vizzuality office. It’s a rare 25 minutes in my schedule where I can reflect on the coming day, the previous week and whatever the future might look like for vizzuality. I’d highly recommend it. On this particularly misty morning, between dodging ruddy faced students cycling to lectures, I find myself reflecting on the first half of 2015 at vizzuality.

When I joined vizzuality last year, it was an easy decision to make. I was confident the world needed vizzuality. I could see from my previous work with the UN Environment Programme that if non-profits and public organisations were to have measurable impact in the digital world, it needed companies like vizzuality to set the bar. I hoped vizzuality would provide a shining light through the mediocrity of vanilla portals and everything-for-no-one “one-stop-shops”. The pied piper of important data products if you will.

So in the last 6 months have we set the bar? Are we dancing along the river, leading the way? Are there any pearls of wisdom we have stumbled on along the way? I’ll let you be the judge. 

# January - Global Forest Watch v3 launch - Listen more to your users than yourself.

We had <a href="http://bit.ly/1C0LPwZ">a big update to Global Forest Watch</a> right at the beginning of the year.

This is one of our favourite projects at vizzuality. Apart from being a great story, it’s one of the few projects with enough time to reflect on what we made, listen to users and enhance it. Often - and this is a general issue across the environment sector - data “services” are “projectised” meaning they are limited in time. Something like knowing where trees are being lost is a service we will need a long way into the future, far beyond when a grant ends. Fortunately, WRI are doing a great job in this regard. And it’s paying off. The update has meant more people are using GFW, <a href="http://bit.ly/1BPWz4x">it’s easier to find the maps and data</a> and people are being inspired to share their stories and to bring deforestation issues to the front. 

It helped we added <a href="www.vizzuality.com/about/jamie-gibson">Jamie Gibson</a> to our team late last year; he’s our first Social Scientist at vizzuality. It’s a no brainer to make sure what we make truly helps the people that see it and his skills at understanding human behaviour will be of great importance in all we do.

# February - a launch of super proportions.

In December 2014, the Google Trends team came to us to see if we could help them with visualising the large volumes of data coming out of their new Trends API. Coming from the world of the UN and environment, my first thought was to do something linked with Climate Change: what is the public perception around the time of the big events, the major disasters, that sort of thing. What I wasn’t expecting was to spend 2 months watching American Football (or just “Football” for those with less of a persuasion towards kicking a ball). It was great fun working out how we could show the American public <a href="http://bit.ly/1Kqzfco">what the rest of the USA thought of their teams</a>. But could we engage people that otherwise would not be interested in sports?

# March - A New Direction

![We started working with the Zeitz Foundation to bring Big Data to Small Screens](/assets/images/posts/69_a.jpg)

Any good futurologist will tell you that the whole world is filling up with people attached to a mobile phone. More data connections, more handsets, a whole group of people connected to the internet that didn’t play jet set willy on the amstrad cpc 464 (look it up). To me what this really means is we can reach people closer to and most affected by problems linked with environmental change. Such as those reliant on <a href="http://bit.ly/ThoughtforFood">small scale farming, predictable rainfall and good access to markets</a>. It’s why we are working with the Zeitz Foundation in Kenya to bring information from satellites to farmers via SMS. It’s a modest start while we figure out what is even possible, but in time I see this as being incredibly important and one of the most impactful things we can do. We call it <a href="http://bit.ly/1NyZMHz">Big Data, Small Screens</a>.

# April - Grow grow grow

Looking back through the blog, we have hired a lot of people this year! <a href="http://bit.ly/1em3h83">Our team has grown to 24</a>. I think it’s a good indicator of how people see the importance of telling stories with data. The importance of design and usability. There are some incredible companies out there doing very cool things with data visualisations and they are all busy. It makes my heart swell that the data world is getting a little more beautiful and easier to understand.

# May - Environmental Democracy Index - People love a bit of competition.

Another month, another launch.

![We launched the EDI in May 2015](/assets/images/projects/EDI_high1.png)

We’re always trying to look at the maps and data products we make and find ways to make them appeal to more people, give them a sprinkle of magic. What we do is important to the world; that’s been in our DNA from the beginning. So when we make something and share it with the world, AND it’s popular, that gives us a real kick. The <a href="http://bit.ly/1Nz0If7">Environmental Democracy Index</a> website was one of those. It was great how many people wanted to compare themselves to their neighbouring country or see where they sat in the league tables of environmental democracy.

# June - Accelerate

I think it would make a great post (probably book!) explaining how David Gonzalez and Sergio Estella, our CTO and Head of Design, manage to get the whole team working across so many pieces of work at such a high standard. Currently working with the World Bank, the European Space Agency, World Resources Institute and the Neptis Foundation, we have really great work coming out over the next few months. It’s going to be an exciting time!

# So what next. Where do we look?

In the last 6 months, the speed of change around data visualisation is lightning. We do a lot of work with maps and it’s pretty clear as each day passes, more and more people will be able to make maps online. And not just any maps, beautiful ones. Primarily led by CartoDB and Mapbox, maps are being commoditised. What I’ve noticed is the standard of lower bar is going up. When people are making maps they don’t look to a vanilla esri map now, or a clunky java applet map (you know who you are academia), they spin something up with CartoDB. So the vanilla now has strawberry chunks and doesn’t give you brain freeze.

I sometimes think of this change in tooling a bit like bringing people out of digital map poverty. From an impact point of view, it’s great; you can quickly raise the level of the beginner map makers, hopefully launching them into bigger and better things. However, if I look around, I haven’t seen a popularising at the other end of the spectrum. Yet. 

There are still the same people doing the remarkable things with maps, the same agencies, the same visualisation academics and freelancers, the same forward thinking non-profits. The reason is simple: once you start trying to make really really high impact digital products, you need a whole bunch of other skills and you need to rely on a much greater slice of luck! 

It’s no longer about finding some data and making a map: it’s a product that needs thought and time. We need to think about design, usability, users, data wrangling, iterative development, client management, product management, simplifying, crafting content, data science, art, time for research and imagination, performance, marketing, metrics. The luck part comes in trying to get these complex intertwined pieces working when often they are not in our control. The rapid change in tooling will reduce the friction in one area but wow, the rest still need a lot of work!! 

On to the next 6 months!
