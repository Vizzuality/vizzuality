When a tree falls, a million ears are listening
===============================================

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/a37329aa24c1378b3e0899f3c1560a96/tumblr_inline_nizzjcuRd71tn8nre.png)

Global Forest Watch was released to the public just over a year ago,
after months of prototyping, development and testing. GFW continued to
be a big part of the lives of almost everyone here at Vizzuality, and we
worked closely with WRI throughout 2014 to develop a new and improved
version, which was released this week.**\
**

Before its first year is even over, it’s had over 615,000 users from 229
countries and territories spending a cumulative time of 3 years, looking
at the maps and data on the site. Having crunched the numbers, we were
able to see what types of user were coming to GFW, how they got there,
and what they did when they got there.  

And many of these users - maybe you’re reading this right now (Hello!) -
have taken the time to give the team comments and suggestions for
improvements. We listened to them and used them to start sketching out
ideas for a new design. From here we built up the final design bit by
bit, presenting new iterations on the design to users and our partners
at WRI, each time learning about what users need, want and expect from
GFW.

This eventually led to the creation of a prototype app which could be
used for more extensive testing, and once everyone was happy that we
were delivering a really helpful and valuable tool we began coding and
implementing the designs you see before you.

The key new features are:

-   <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">a complete
    re-design of the GFW pages and its content architecture to make it
    easier to find the data you need</span>\
-   <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">better
    integration with the other GFW tools and platforms, like Fires and
    Commodities</span>\
-   <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">improved
    data workflows, automating many of them, and adding new high
    resolution datasets, like terra-i alerts</span>\
-   <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">a new layer
    looking at intact forest landscapes evolution</span>\
-   <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">improved
    feedback workflows, so your comments are fully integrated into the
    design of GFW</span>\

\

It’s been a labour of love, and here it is: [**why not take it for a
test drive?**](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) We asked the team what
they think, and here’s what they had to say:

**Sergio Estella, Head of Design:** “We were looking at two key points
from the beginning: to make the website ‘easy-to-use’; and to give the
whole GFW platform a 'consistent’ and 'coherent’ feel. It was great
working with WRI and some of our users to understand exactly what GFW
needed to deliver, and this helped us ensure that every feature was in
the right place and that every tiny little detail (even down to the text
in the menus) delighted and excited users.”

**David Gonzalez, CTO:** “We have learnt so much from users and partners
during this latest phase of development, and we successfully used that
knowledge to combine heterogeneous tools and sources into an
easy-to-use, advanced interface. We’ve also brought in much more data at
a higher resolution than before, so you can see even more detail than
ever before. I’m so happy with the current version, but even more I’m
looking forward to hearing comments from users and continuing to push
GFW forward into the future.”

**Adrian Perez, Lead Developer:** “Since I arrived at Vizzuality last
March, GFW has been a really fun and rewarding projects to work.  I’ve
tried to channel all this enjoyment into the way I’ve been implementing
the designs and developing the new GFW; I hope you love the new, more
responsive website as much as I do!”

**Alicia Arenzana, Data Scientist:** “I arrived at Vizzuality in
October, and it’s been great to work with such a creative team on such
an important project used by so many people. I was in charge of testing
GFW, which meant running it in the wide variety of browsers used (from
the latest Chrome to IE 9), fixing bugs, then testing again, and
iterating over and over until it was absolutely perfect.”

**Craig Mills, CEO:** “Vizzuality always tries to work on things that
can have an impact on society. Right now, there are few things in the
environmental space that have had as much impact, or are used as much as
GFW. It’s been great to work with such a forward thinking organisation
in WRI.”

**[What did you think of the new
GFW?](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/getinvolved/provide-feedback)**
We are committed to bringing you the best tools possible, so you can
continue monitoring trends in the world’s forests and protecting them
for future generations to enjoy. It is this impact that makes us so
proud and pleased to work on this project, and with WRI. So if you have
any more comments or suggestions, please let us know! With this release
complete, we move forward with renewed vigour. We are already working on
new features that will allow you to do even more on GFW than ever; your
comments are as vital and essential as ever.\
