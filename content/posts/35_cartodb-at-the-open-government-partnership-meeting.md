CartoDB at the Open Government Partnership meeting
==================================================

![](http://cartodb.s3.amazonaws.com/tumblr/posts/opg.png)

The [Open Government
Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) (OGP) first annual
conference started yesterday in Brasilia, Brasil. The meeting will
welcome near 1,000 representatives from more than 60 countries to
discuss the latest reforms, tools and innovations in the open government
field.

The partnership has grown rapidly. Just last September, eight countries
launched it to formalize their commitment to a more open, transparent
use of information. Another 43 additional governments have joined the
OGP in the last months. 

The Brasilia two-day event is the biggest conference related with Open
Government ever, and it will be supported with the attendance of Dilma
Rousseff and Hillary Clinton. You can check the
agenda [here](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/Brasilia2012/Agenda).

Vizzuality will be presenting several projects, particularly the Open
Goverment Experience Locator (image above), developed together with the
OGP and the [World Bank Institute](http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/). This
tool allows the exploitation of different Open Government implementation
experiences. The Experience Locator features initiatives from around the
world, with special emphasis on presenting the insights from
practitioners involved, links to implementing partners and related
resources for further exploration. It has been entirely developed on
CartoDB.

Ruth del Campo will be at the [Innovation
Village](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/news/innovation-village) in
the [Open Aid Register](http://www.openaidregister.org/) stand (another
CartoDB-based platform) showing demos of the OGP Locator tool, together
with CartoDB. She will also be showcasing how CartoDB can help you
create maps with your data fast and easy. This is especially interesting
in the field of Open Government, where Open Data is crucial and there is
so much to be visualized and geolocated.

So, if you are around in Brasilia feel free to pass by our booth at the
Innovation Village and say hi or try to
reach [@ruthdelcampo](http://twitter.com/#!/ruthdelcampo) at anytime. We
would love to show you how Open Source CartoDB can enable you to do much
more with much less.
