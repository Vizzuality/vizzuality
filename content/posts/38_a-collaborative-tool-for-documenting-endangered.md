A collaborative tool for documenting endangered languages
=========================================================

We just finished a new project called [Endangered Languages
Project](http://www.endangeredlanguages.com), an online collaborative
effort to protect global linguistic diversity. We developed it for the
Alliance for Linguistic Diversity under the direction and supervision of
Google.org.

![](http://cartodb.s3.amazonaws.com/tumblr/posts/el_home.png)

It is estimated that half of 6,000 plus languages spoken today will
disappear by the end of this century if nothing is done to prevent it.
There is a need of new tools and services to reverse this trend and keep
all languages alive, especially those unwritten and still undocumented
–and at higher risk of becoming extinct in the near future. 

The information available about many languages “is scant or outdated”,
according to the Linguistic Society of America. In order to preserve
them, linguists are trying to collect as much information as
possible. The goal of the Endangered Languages Project was to develop a
collaborative site to facilitate the work of linguists and volunteers
documenting endangered languages, and empower their effort.

This [video](http://youtu.be/Bn2QbwcjmOI) introduces the initiative.

From the technical side, it was a challenge. We had to design a
user-friendly tool considering different kinds of users and their
respective needs: From expert linguists to language speakers and
volunteers from all around the world. We had to edit and display the
almost-raw academic documentation in an attractive and meaningful way
while preserving its rigor. The site also had to support standards like
OLAC to describe language metadata.

The resulting tool we have built is a robust, scalable site with full
information about more than 3,000 endangered languages. Registered users
can enhance or correct any entries, and provide new samples and
documents about languages. 

“You can hear the heartbreaking, beautiful sound of
[Koro](http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/7649) being sung, or read
18th century manuscripts written in a nearly-dead Native American
tongue”, says an article on the project published at
[Mashable](http://mashable.com/2012/06/21/google-org-fights-to-save-3054-languages/). 

“Documenting the 3,000+ languages that are on the verge of extinction is
an important step in preserving cultural diversity,” write project
managers Clara Rivera Rodriguez and Jason Rissman, from Google.org. 

The Endangered Languages Project promotes a full collaboration between
linguists and the general public to empower the documentation of
endangered languages. We are very proud to be part of this great effort.
