Research in raster tiles - Expansion of the European Starling
=============================================================

Last week, we launched a new visualization with the objective of trying
the raster representation of data to further filter in the client and
allowing much more rich story telling.

We could not resist and with the help of Tim Robertson preparing the
raster tiles for the starling, we prepared the [following demo
application](http://vizzuality.s3.amazonaws.com/starling/index.html "European Starling demo vizz").

[![European Starling
mashup](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kwecqvLlJD1qaaftg.jpg)](http://vizzuality.s3.amazonaws.com/starling/index.html "European Starling mashup")

Drag the slider from 1880 to 2010 to see the accumulative records (by
date recorded) for the data available on the GBIF network. While you
drag the slider you will be presented with tooltips mostly taken from
Wikipedia.\
\
Soon we will release all the source code, once a bit cleaned, and will
share more technical details. And the best is yet to come… we only used
one band on this demo, but we have 3 to play with!!\
\
I hope you like it and want to share some comments.\
\
Ah! Dont forget to turn on sound!

We published a [more technical post on
biodivertid](http://biodivertido.blogspot.com "biodivertido")o sharing
more thoughts about the visualization and explaining more about the
proccess that we followed.
