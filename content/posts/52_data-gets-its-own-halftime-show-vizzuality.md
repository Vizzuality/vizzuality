Data gets its own halftime show: Vizzuality launches the new Google Trends API
==============================================================================

[See the final product here](http://bit.ly/1Kqzfco)\

Vizzuality loves working with NGOs to make tools and visualisations that
have a real impact on society and our environment. From [Global Forest
Watch](http://globalforestwatch.org) to the [Cash
Atlas](http://cash-atlas.org), we’ve tried to tell stories that matter
and deliver delight to users from across the globe. We also try to push
the boundaries of technology, working at the edge of APIs to perfectly
implement the sumptuous designs our team create.

With this project we were able to do both. The Super Bowl is one of the
biggest stories there is: last year’s attracted the largest television
audience in the US of all time. And being asked to work with Google on
their new Google Trends API was a challenge we couldn’t miss!

Our task was simple: visualise the search patterns of the USA’s NFL fans
over the 2014-2015 season. Over the last 3 weeks, our team of designers,
developers and data scientists have pored over 21 weeks of data to see
which teams are being searched for in which parts of the country. With
all this geospatial data to crunch, we turned to our good friends at
CartoDB for a powerful back-end for the visualisations. Week by week we
were able to see fans reacting to the biggest plays, the hard fought
comebacks and the surprise victories of the season, and we hope you love
the final products!

[Visualisation 1](http://bit.ly/1Kqzfco) shows, for each DMA, the most
searched team each week. The key events were chosen based on the overall
level of searching across the country for that week. You can clearly see
the most popular teams in the leagues and how far their heartlands
extend over neighbouring states, but you can also see the ebbs and flows
around the really spectacular events, like Peyton Manning claiming the
TD pass record in Week 7 or Green Bay Packers’ rout of the Chicago Bears
in Week 10.

[Visualisation 2](http://bit.ly/1Kqz8O3) narrows this story down for the
Super Bowl contestants: New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. We
took a slightly different approach, showing the variation in strength of
searches across the country; you can clearly see the strongholds near
each team’s base. We also added key stats from the matches played each
week to illustrate the key events of each week, as context for what
people were searching for each week.

For a system that is already having a huge impact by helping to track
the spread of diseases, we’re really excited by the future uses for
Google Trends. Imagine if you could track flood events from people
searching for ‘sandbags’ or ‘local weather’, or use searches for ‘food
banks’ or ‘food stamps’ to reveal the extent of poverty and
malnourishment… We look forward to working with the trends API into the
future.
