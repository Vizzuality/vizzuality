Vizzuality loves working with NGOs to make tools and visualisations that have a real impact on society and our environment. From [Global Forest Watch](http://globalforestwatch.org) to the [Cash Atlas](http://cash-atlas.org), we’ve tried to tell stories that matter and deliver delight to users from across the globe. We also try to push the boundaries of technology, working at the edge of APIs to perfectly implement the sumptuous designs our team create.

With this project we were able to do both. The Super Bowl is one of the biggest stories there is: last year’s attracted the largest television audience in the US of all time. And being asked to work with Google on their new Google Trends API was a challenge we couldn’t miss!

Our task was simple: visualise the search patterns of the USA’s NFL fans over the 2014-2015 season. Over the last 3 weeks, our team of designers, developers and data scientists have pored over 21 weeks of data to see which teams are being searched for in which parts of the country. With all this geospatial data to crunch, we turned to our good friends at CartoDB for a powerful back-end for the visualisations. Week by week we were able to see fans reacting to the biggest plays, the hard fought comebacks and the surprise victories of the season, and we hope you love the final products!

[Visualisation 1](http://bit.ly/1Kqzfco) shows, for each DMA, the most searched team each week. The key events were chosen based on the overall level of searching across the country for that week. You can clearly see the most popular teams in the leagues and how far their heartlands extend over neighbouring states, but you can also see the ebbs and flows around the really spectacular events, like Peyton Manning claiming the TD pass record in Week 7 or Green Bay Packers’ rout of the Chicago Bears in Week 10.

[Visualisation 2](http://bit.ly/1Kqz8O3) narrows this story down for the Super Bowl contestants: New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. We took a slightly different approach, showing the variation in strength of searches across the country; you can clearly see the strongholds near each team’s base. We also added key stats from the matches played each week to illustrate the key events of each week, as context for what people were searching for each week.

For a system that is already having a huge impact by helping to track the spread of diseases, we’re really excited by the future uses for Google Trends. Imagine if you could track flood events from people searching for ‘sandbags’ or ‘local weather’, or use searches for ‘food banks’ or ‘food stamps’ to reveal the extent of poverty and malnourishment… We look forward to working with the trends API into the future.
