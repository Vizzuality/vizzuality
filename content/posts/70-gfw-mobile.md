I’ve been working on <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/global-forest-watch">Global Forest Watch</a> for 15 months now and it’s been great to take it from strength to strength with every new feature. There’s been some cool technology challenges to take on, but it’s even sweeter working on something to keep trees in the ground and protect our planet.

The biggest news of the day is that it now works seamlessly on mobile. This is a big milestone for us; the process started back in January with the new design, which paved the way for a fully responsive website. With some small design tweaks and a heap of customisations, we’ve ironed out the final kinks and our baby can now walk on its own two legs on any device. 

One issue with translating the successful desktop experience to mobile is making the map respond effectively on a mobile screen, especially to display the menus and info windows without hiding the map. Take a country analysis for example: it takes no more than three taps to get to the analysis. And if you want to download the data once you go back to your desktop, you just need to fill in your email address and the data will be waiting for you in your inbox when you want to download it.

Why not take your phone for a walk this weekend and let GFW mobile show you around your local forests? Use the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hometownforests&src=typd">#hometownforests</a> to share your stories! To find out more <a href="http://blog.globalforestwatch.org/2015/07/gfw-goes-mobile-putting-forest-information-in-the-palm-of-your-hand/">read this excellent post by the team at WRI</a>.

Another new feature is ‘view the data in CartoDB’. Were you bored of downloading an analysis and waiting for it to be ready in your computer, just to upload it again to CartoDB? Well, not any more! Now you can just export it directly from the results of your analysis on the map. So far only the US Open Data portal has added this, and it’s a cool feature to give you even more powerful analysis.

Global Forest Watch now has an alert system too, nestled between the analyse data and country mode options. Choose a country or define your area and we’ll tell you when there’s new data to look at; there’s no need to check periodically for new alerts in the same defined region. This was another transatlantic effort, with our team in Madrid working with the WRI Data Lab. 

We’ve also taken big steps with the local data mode since we released it earlier this year. Alicia, our data scientist, has been working behind the scenes over the last few weeks to get a whole bunch of data ready, including local layers for Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, Colombia, Gabon and Ghana and a couple of global layers, like major dams and updates to Terra-i. 

Thanks to all of you out there for using Global Forest Watch, we’re glad you like it!
