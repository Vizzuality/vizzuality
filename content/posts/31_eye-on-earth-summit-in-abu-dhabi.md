Eye On Earth summit in Abu Dhabi
================================

![](http://www.eyeonearthsummit.org/sites/all/themes/eoe/images/logo.png)The
[Eye on Earth summit](http://www.eyeonearthsummit.org/) started on
Monday 12th in Abu Dhabi. The conference is addressing the crucial
importance of environmental and societal information and networking to
decision-making.

Vizzuality is very aligned with the objetives of the summit and the
declaration that has been signed. We have been working on Biodiversity
and Conservation since we started and we hope that the work we do with
our partners help move toward a more sustainable world.

Javier de la Torre is been presenting also some of our projects in the
conference, like [Imazon](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/imazon), a
project together with Google and Imazon and
[OldWeather](http://oldweather.org/), but many of other of our projects
where presented, like [GeoCAT](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/rlat),
[ProtectedPlanet](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/protectedplanet),
[GBIF](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/wdpagbif), etc.

Now, that we have launched [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), our Open
Source geospatial database on the cloud, we are working with many
different organizations to help them analyze, visualize and share their
environmental data.

We look forward to join forces with partners to develop the technologies
and platforms that will enable a truly integrated environmental data
network that will help to make better conservation decisions. And if
this movement is driven by Open Source so that everybody is included, we
will be delighted.
