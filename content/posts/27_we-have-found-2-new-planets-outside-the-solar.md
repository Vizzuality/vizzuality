We have found 2 new planets outside the solar system
====================================================

Well, it might sound a bit too pretentious, but we can definitely say we
have helped on finding 2 new planets outside the solar system. All
thanks to the great PlanetHunters.org project.

The candidate planets had been confirmed on a recent published paper:

![](http://blogs.zooniverse.org/planethunters/files/2011/09/title-1024x712.png)

The publication is pretty rough, but the good guys from[PlanetHunters
have published a blog post explaining
it.](http://blogs.zooniverse.org/planethunters/2011/09/22/first_two_planet_candidates/)
Now, how do these planets look like? We can not really offer you an
image of the planets, but here are some pics from their stars.

Congratulations to all volunteers who have help science on
planethunters.org. Citizen Science is proving project by project that
new ways to do science are possible by engaging the general public. Now
that we have found planets outside the solar system, what about doing
some citizen science to help the environment on our own planet? More
coming soon!
