I’m just back from Cape Verde where I spent a week working out how to solve a fundamentally human problem in the non-profit space. 

**How can project teams share their experience so others can use them to develop the next even more effective, successful project?**

After a week with the team from the UN Development Programme and University of Warwick, I thought it would be worth reflecting on a few ideas I think will tackle this simple problem. 

##How do we get other people in UNDP to know this resource exists?

* **Word of mouth** - we want people to say “hey, you *have* to use this, it’s made my life so much easier”, rather than ‘hey you have to use this because we told you to’. That means what we build actually has to do that: excite people so much they tell all their friends. We’ll keep testing it over and over to make sure it does. There are some great resources from the [UK Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/discovery.html) that apply in this situation. 
* **Your favourite search engine** - People will only come to the site if they can find it, or rather if their search engine of choice can find the content and present it to you. So we’ll be trying a bunch of techniques to optimise the site for search engines to make sure you can find it with ease.

##If we are building a website to gather lessons learned and project information, how can we gather that data with minimal burden? 

* **Automate as much as possible**. We’ve all experienced shared folder apathy right? To cure that we’re going to be experimenting with artificial intelligence and techniques to automatically tag and organise project data. It will require some initial training by humans, but once up and running we hope this will remove a lot of the time and effort people spend cataloguing and categorising things so that other humans can find them. 

##How will we make it easy to find information?

* **Engage people’s curiosity from the start**. Once the horde of data-hungry practitioners makes it to the site, they’ll want to find the right data quickly and easily. With an intuitive search feature and interactive visualisations for people to play with the data and find a new angle on it, the site should empower people to explore and discover the site.  
* **Follow principles of beautiful, great design**. From designing every single feature of a site (pixel perfection) to laying a trail of visual incentives that guides a user through the site to the valuable content, it’s all about clarity, delight and excitement. If people find it easy to use, they’ll have a great first experience and are more likely to come back for more. 

Those are just my first thoughts. As with all projects, I’ll spend a few weeks analysing the users, the data, the design problems we need to address and see what unfolds. One of the best things about working at Vizzuality is working on things that actually matter. Well that and having a meeting on a beach.

p.s. I didn’t make it to the beach. I was too busy working. Promise.
