Visualizing the latest spanish elections
========================================

One month ago we were contacted by the spanish public TV. They wanted us
to work on visualizing the results of the upcoming spanish elections
(the 22nd of May). Of course we decided from the beginning that we did
not want “just another” election map. So we started thinking about what
could be the most interesting thing to display together with the
results. Immediately we ended up looking at different indicators, like
age, inmigration, unemploeyment, etc. to see if we could find
correlations and start telling stories. Well, the concept evolved, we
worked hard and yesterday we launched.

*Click the image to visit the application.*

This is the first big project that we develop using the
[CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) technology for map rendering and as a
geospatial database on the cloud. And we have learnt a lot from it.
We now know better how CartoDB can be used in these kind of highly viral
projects (lot of traffic).

We found the development particularly interesting because it included
two main things: lot of frontend development and lot of data processing.
And being data junks as we are, going deep into Open Public data
is something we enjoy.

There is also some curious parts of the application, like the animated
graphs, dynamic comparison of different variables and many other little
goodies. The application is quite extensive and provide lot of different
ways to view and understand the data.

Finally here you can find a little video we prepared using Gource to
display the development of the application over the 3 weeks that we
worked on it.

Hope you like it!
