HTML5 for Rich Geospatial applications on the web
=================================================

Today Javier Alvarez made a great presentation at \#FOSS4G on how to use
HTML5 new technologies for web mapping.

In front of a packed room full of geo geeks, he demoed several of our
most innovative projects in terms on web mapping. Unfortunately we dont
have the video, but at least we can show you his great slides. Which for
an extra geek factor, he developed on HTML and JS with embedded maps and
so on. Pity you could not see it, because he georeferenced live where to
go and eat spanish serrano ham!
