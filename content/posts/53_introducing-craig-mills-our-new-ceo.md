For those of you with a keen eye, you may have noticed over the last few months we’ve had a new CEO at the helm of Vizzuality! Fresh from his time working with the United Nations, Craig Mills arrived at Vizzuality eager to continue and expand Vizzuality’s impact. At around the same time, [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), everybody’s favourite mapping platform, reached a level of success where it was time to leave the Vizzuality nest and become its own company with its own vision. An exciting time for the two companies to strive to improve the world!

Craig comes to us with deep strategic experience, vision and drive at a crucial time for the company. Our mission at Vizzuality has always been to work with organisations to improve our world, whether that’s [mapping species](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/rlat), [discovering planets](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/planethunters) or [watching the world’s forests in near-real time](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/). The world is mobilising like never before to deliver this impact, and Craig will oversee our plan to support more organisations to deliver the products needed to make a difference.  

Over the next few months, Craig will be announcing some of our marvellous new initiatives, products and partnerships. Each one with the same focus on design, usability and joy. 2015 is going to be a special year!

He is based in our Cambridge office, but is often out and about meeting people, discussing new ideas and launching new products. [Why not follow him on twitter](https://twitter.com/craigmmills) to see if he’s near you? He’d love to chat over a nice cup of builders tea (milk, 6 sugars)…
