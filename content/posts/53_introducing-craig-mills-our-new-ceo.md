Introducing Craig Mills, our new CEO
====================================

![image](https://31.media.tumblr.com/0a78c1e2c987a450737c9b31a3e04b87/tumblr_inline_njx23zeqCY1tn8nre.jpg)

\

For those of you with a keen eye, you may have noticed over the last few
months we’ve had a new CEO at the helm of Vizzuality! Fresh from his
time working with the United Nations, Craig Mills arrived at Vizzuality
eager to continue and expand Vizzuality’s impact. At around the same
time, [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), everybody’s favourite mapping
platform, reached a level of success where it was time to leave the
Vizzuality nest and become its own company with its own vision. An
exciting time for the two companies to strive to improve the world!

Craig comes to us with deep strategic experience, vision and drive at a
crucial time for the company. Our mission at Vizzuality has always been
to work with organisations to improve our world, whether that’s [mapping
species](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/rlat), [discovering
planets](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/planethunters) or [watching
the world’s forests in near-real
time](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/). The world is mobilising like
never before to deliver this impact, and Craig will oversee our plan to
support more organisations to deliver the products needed to make a
difference.  

Over the next few months, Craig will be announcing some of our
marvellous new initiatives, products and partnerships.  Each one with
the same focus on design, usability and joy. 2015 is going to be a
special year!

He is based in our Cambridge office, but is often out and about meeting
people, discussing new ideas and launching new products. [Why not follow
him on twitter](https://twitter.com/craigmmills) to see if he’s near
you? He’d love to chat over a nice cup of builders tea (milk, 6 sugars)…
