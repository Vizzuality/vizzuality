EcoHack is back, and this time it’s global! May 9th & 10th
==========================================================

![](http://i.imgur.com/wTuYZiT.jpg)

Today, we are excited to announce the next [EcoHack
World](http://ecohack.org/), the continuation of our three year mission
to bring scientists, journalists, digital storytellers, software
engineers, designers, and other hackers into the same room to tackle
issues that matter. If you haven’t been before, EcoHack is about using
technology to improve and better understand our natural environment,
creating things that will have an impact, with no restrictions on how
you get there. In the past, EcoHack has hosted everything from teams
creating data visualizations to teams building kites to fly cameras. We
have seen that by giving people an opportunity to collaborate on
important environmental challenges that we can come up with innovative
solutions.

**It’s Global!**

For the first time ever, EcoHack will be a global event, with hackathons
in New York City, San Francisco, and São Paulo, Brazil happening at the
same time. <span
id="docs-internal-guid-1f38c194-da83-4243-cced-39130a1e56f9">This year
[Public Lab](http://publiclab.org/),
[Vizzuality](http://www.vizzuality.com/), [World Resources
Institute](http://datalab.wri.org/), and [Environmental News
Lab](http://lab.oeco.org.br/) have teamed together to organize this two
day event across these locations.</span>

<span
id="docs-internal-guid-1f38c194-da83-4243-cced-39130a1e56f9"></span>**New
Climate Track**

The Obama administration is today launching the Climate Data Initiative,
an initiative to help individuals, organizations, and governments better
understand the effects of climate change. The initiative is focused on
the use of open data to help advance environmental science,
preparedness, and education. In support of this important initiative, we
have added a Climate Track to EcoHack World. We are going to look for
the most interesting and innovative hack proposals related to climate
change to bring to our events. If you have an app or visualization idea
related to climate change, consider submitting to one of our three
EcoHack locations. We’ll work hard to support your project and all the
teams at the events.

If can be in one of our three host cities on May 9th and 10th, [register
for free](http://ecohack.org/) and be sure to join us! If you have an
important project you want to build a team around at EcoHack, be sure to
submit those through the EcoHack website soon!
