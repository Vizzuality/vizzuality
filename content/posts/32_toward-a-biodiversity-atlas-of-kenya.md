Toward a Biodiversity Atlas of Kenya
====================================

This week we are taking part in the Kenya Biodiversity Atlas and
Decision Making Platform planning workshop hosted by the
[ACC](http://www.conservationafrica.org/en/ "ACC"). There are two medium
term goals of this workshop: the first is to produce a hard copy
Biodiversity Atlas for Kenya, the second is to produce broader and
evolving online resource for the data, information, and analyses that go
into a Kenyan Biodiversity Atlas. There is a longer-term goal to then
make the technologies available throughout the region. To help make the
work successful, the ACC has brought together representative many
regional organizations and agencies such as
[TAWIRI](http://www.tawiri.or.tz/ "TAWIRI") and
[ARCOS](http://arcosnetwork.org/ "ARCOS") as well as global organization
such as the [WCMC](http://www.unep-wcmc.org/ "WCMC"),
[WWF](http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/eastern_southern_africa/ "WWF"),
and members of the group at [WRI](http://www.wri.org/ "WRI") responsible
for [virtualkenya.org](http://www.virtualkenya.org/ "Virtual Kenya").

The discussion has been exciting, positive, and very on target. I was
asked to give a presentation and focused on several ideas, including the
importance of data access and availability, supporting science at
multiple levels, work toward immediate deliverables and successes to
drive continued development, and being open openly. In some of the
breakout sessions I have also presented some of the technologies we have
been building into [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/ "CartoDB") and have
discussed how our cloud based solution (especially for large geospatial
data) could very capably support many goals of the project.

Before we have even completed the meeting, I think I have come to
understand a few key take aways here. First, data openness and
accessibility in Kenya and regionally is still lacking in many areas key
to an online Atlas’s success.  Bandwidth and accessibility are
ever-present concerns when building an online tool in Kenya. These
challenges are not insurmountable, and all parties at the meeting are
aware of the need for such a resource, both to ensure Kenya is
recognized as a biodiversity knowledge and wealth, but also to help
drive forward data and communication in Kenya.

I am excited for this project to take off, as I am confident it will be
a valuable resource for Kenya and beyond.
