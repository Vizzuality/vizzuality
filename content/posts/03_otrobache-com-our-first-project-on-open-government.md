Otrobache.com our first project on Open Government and Open311
==============================================================

Madrid is full of potholes! And people are reporting them a lot, 90
daily, but this data is not public and there is no way to know how many
are out there and when they get fixed. This is the first of some more
projects we are working around the idea of Open Government. We would
really like to see some of the initiatives from US and other countries,
applied in Spain.

We wanted to develop something quick and not complicate. Fortunately at
the sametime we were thinking about developing the project, the new
Google Fusion Tables API just appeared. With Fusion Tables it is pretty
easy to develop truly scalable mapping solutions based on Google Maps.
With a bit of code here and there we developed over a weekend a website
with no database backend, only mashing up APIs.

On the other hand we are getting more and more into mobile phone
development, and with the current Iphones, Androids, etc all equipped
with GPS, every mobile is a sensor device! So we are currently
developing an Iphone and Android applications to help people submit
potholes just in place. Please ask us to enter the beta program.

Expect more and more tools from us about Open Government and Open311 in
the next months. Meanwhile report potholes in Spain!
