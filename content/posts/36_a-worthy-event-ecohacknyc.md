A Worthy Event: EcoHackNYC
==========================

*Vizzuality has contributed this post to the New York Botanical Garden
blog. You can read it
also [here](http://www.nybg.org/plant-talk/2012/04/learning/a-worthy-event-ecohacknyc/). *

<span>This weekend, for the second time in under a year, we are throwing
an event to bring together scientists, developers, designers, and others
to work collaboratively on environmental projects that matter. We call
this
event </span>[EcoHackNYC](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/ "Ecohack NYC")<span>.
It is a free (un)conference where a small group of people present
projects, problems, or data they think need to be developed, and then
larger groups of enthusiasts and experts work tirelessly to develop
solutions (also check out last year’s
event </span>[here](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/2011/index.html "Ecohack NYC")<span>).
For us, this is a special event.</span>

<span></span><span>We have been working primarily on projects in
biodiversity, conservation, and the environment, guided by a genuine
passion and belief in the societal value of such projects and a love of
working in domains that present multifaceted challenges, not the least
of which is visually explaining meaningful knowledge. We are optimistic
that scientific research results will drive forward new ways of
understanding and communicating scientific information and will
ultimately improve the world around us.</span>

<span></span><span>EcoHackNYC was conceived to help reduce one major
obstacle in the way of the science we love: scientists, technologists,
and designers have very few forums to cross-fertilize and forge new
collaborations. Please come and join us with all of your beautiful ideas
and diverse talents to help drive forward the technologies and solutions
we so desperately need.</span>

<span></span>*Registration for this event is [still
open](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3156640597?ref=ebtn "Eventbrite").*
