We are very proud to announce the latest release of Global Forest Watch. In addition to exciting new data, this release includes a number of improvements that make it easier to view, analyze, and download data at both a local and global scale.

But first, the biggest change of all: GFW now displays the latest deforestation data for 2013 from the University of Maryland. You can now explore and analyse this data, which is already creating [headlines](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850) around the world.

Then we went one step further. How many times have you analysed deforestation within your country? It used to be a long process, but now it’s a click away. And what’s more, we’ve started adding country-specific data layers (activate DRC’s forest titles layer, for example). We’re not finished yet though; if you have other country-specific data, why not [suggest them as additions to GFW](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/getinvolved/share-data)? Once you’ve finished your analysis, you can jump from your country in the map to the country page, or from the country page to the analysis as before.

While developing this ‘local data feature,’ we also made some general tweaks to the map to allow you to make the most of this great new data. We hope you love it. It took a few weeks to get all these changes right, from sketches to prototypes to the final version - it took a lot of care and love to craft an elegant interface.

We also spent a lot of time working with the great team at [WRI’s Data Lab](http://datalab.wri.org/) to advance the API; it’s now more robust and useful. Together we integrated the new features into the site, and also created better documentation to allow other developers to use GFW data and features in their own sites. We can’t wait to work with those guys in the future to keep pushing the back end forward.

Feel free to share these exciting updates; people from [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/10/google-earth-engine-maps-forest-watch-deforestation-environment) and [Vice](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-world-lost-an-oklahoma-sized-amount-of-forest-in-2013-satellite-data-shows) have already. And not only in English, they’ve shared it from [Russia with some Spanish love](http://actualidad.rt.com/ciencias/170423-parches-bosque-intacto-tierra). And you’ll always find the latest news on the [GFW blog](http://blog.globalforestwatch.org/). Even better, why not let us know what you think (we’d be much obliged) or [report any gremlins you see](https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw/issues)!

GFW is now much easier, prettier, and quicker - the three pillars of web development - and we’re proud to share it. Enjoy!
