Get ready for EcoHackNYC!
=========================

Last November, we helped create the first ever
[EcoHack](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/2011/index.html "EcoHackNYC 2011")
unconference here in NYC. The idea was to bring together people from
different backgrounds into the same room to tackle real problems related
to the environment. It was an amazing event that drew project ideas and
solutions from a diverse crowd of designers, coders, scientists and
other amazing people.  At the end of that first weekend, we asked the
participants how soon they would like to see another event.
Overwhelmingly the answer was in less than a year. So now, we are
announcing the second [EcoHackNYC to be held April 20th and
21st](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/ "EcoHackNYC")] at the Parsons Design
and Technology lab. We will also be working to find places to showcase
some of the outcomes on Earth Day, April 22nd!\
\
In order to keep growing and bringing new ideas to the event, we have
joined forces with the [Public
Laboratory](http://publiclaboratory.org/home "Public Lab") to help draw
a community of hardware hackers and data collectors to EcoHackNYC. Think
balloons, air sampling, and image collection! They are also making
hardware available for hacking during the event. This doesn’t mean we
wont still be doing all the data and code hacking from last year too!\
\
Just like the first EcoHackNYC, we will kick off the event with Ignite
talks where you can present the ideas you want to work on for the
weekend. So start thinking about what data, technology, or hardware you
think we should be creating or improving and submit those ideas. This
will be a really exciting weekend that offers the chance to work on
projects that may help change the world. So [head over to the
site](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/ "EcoHackNYC")], register, and get ready
for a great time!
