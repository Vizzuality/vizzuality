Irekia 2.0, an Open Government platform developed by Vizzuality
===============================================================

The Basque Government, the governing body of the Basque Region in Spain,
has recently launched [Irekia 2.0](http://www.irekia.euskadi.net/), an
Open Government platform based on a prototype conceptualized and
developed by Vizzuality. It’s been one of the most challenging projects
we’ve been involved in, and we’re very proud of the result.  

Irekia is an online platform to let citizens be heard in the Basque
decision taking. Version 2.0 seeks to enhance the project, launched in
2010, creating a direct communication channel between the citizens and
the Administration. In order to meet this goal, we built an open source
social network and added new capacities to the platform.

You can check a working prototype
[here](http://irekia-staging.ipq.co/).

Among other features, Irekia 2.0 allows citizens and representatives to
create a profile, send in comments and appraisals, and vote on the
government initiatives and proposals. As the participation between
politicians and citizens is the key part of the project, we also
developed a mobile application to facilitate the use of Irekia by local
representatives. They can update their profile, upload images and
videos, and answer questions made by citizens wherever they are.

To promote transparency, the new version will also include open data and
an archive of images from the Basque Government. 

By defining new ways for citizens to understand and interact with their
government, we hope the new Irekia 2.0 will make the Basque Country one
of the most Open Government places in the world. As usually, everything
is open source. You can fork the project
