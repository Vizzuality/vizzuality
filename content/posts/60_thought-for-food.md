We’re bringing satellite data to smallholders
---------------------------------------------

Vizzuality are embarking on a major new research project with the Zeitz Foundation, which aims to empower thousands of the poorest farmers in Kenya with big data insights to tackle the key issues limiting their food security. We will be working with smallholder farmers in Laikipia County to build a system that distills a range of different types of data, from satellite observation to market prices, into SMS messages sent to farmers’ phones. This data would also be available on a dashboard-style web application, allowing interested users (like regional government staff or NGOs) to analyse multiple farms at the same time. In this post we explain why we’re doing this work and what we hope to achieve.

Farming faces many threats
--------------------------

In Laikipia County, there are three main environmental issues limiting farm productivity. Above all is the impact of climate change. The Kenyan Government is expecting both more flooding and drought, as rainfall becomes more unpredictable, and models suggest temperatures could rise by at least 3ºC by the end of the century. On top of this is the increasing demand for water from a growing population and booming agricultural businesses. Third is the risk posed by wild animals, particularly elephants, that can destroy crops, livestock and buildings.

A further issue facing smallholder farming comes from low access to markets, which reduces opportunities to access productive inputs and earn revenue from any excess output. This in turn can reduce the ability of smallholder farmers to continue farming into the future. It is for this reason that the African Smallholder Farmers’ Group has put market
access as one of its 5 pillars for improving smallholder livelihoods.

There are a number of different initiatives, spearheaded by some of the biggest donors and research organisations in the world, exploring new techniques to overcome these threats. Existing work by the Zeitz Foundation in Laikipia suggests that Conservation Agriculture, Rainwater Harvesting and Human Wildlife Conflict mitigation have the potential to dramatically increase the productivity of smallholder farms in the area.

More and more farmers find information on their phones
------------------------------------------------------

Another method used to improve smallholder productivity has been to develop information systems that deliver information, on things like weather or market prices, through SMS services. One such service in East Africa already sends 30,000 SMS messages a month; so there is clearly a lot of potential there. However, reports by the FAO and USAID suggest that women are less able to access these services than men; working with the Zeitz Foundation and communities in Laikipia, we also hope to redress the gender imbalance of the audience.

In the future, we will be able to do more than just text smallholders. Research suggests that the trend in mobile ownership and use is only likely to accelerate into the future: it is anticipated that 4bn adults will own a smartphone by 2020, and around 300 million people in the Middle East and Africa region should have access to a 4G network. Within a few short years we will be able to send customised maps and rich visualisations to help smallholders plan and manage their land more effectively, and level the playing field in terms of access to information.

Straight from satellites to SMS
-------------------------------

The most exciting part of this project for us is the potential to work with big earth observation data to provide cheap and timely insights on a whole range of environmental parameters. Smallholders are rarely able to access the knowledge we gain from satellites, like land cover change and weather prediction. With the ESA and NASA both launching more powerful satellites, able to tell us more about our planet than ever before, now is the time to pair this capability with the needs of some of the poorest people in the world. If we can build a system that presents this data to smallholders in a clear, relevant way, it could unlock the massive potential of smallholder populations.  

Giving smallholders the tools to secure their own livelihoods
-------------------------------------------------------------

What we want to do with this project is build a system that gives smallholders the information they need, in their hands right when they need it, to build more productive, climate and biodiversity smart farming systems. With this, smallholders can learn about upcoming weather events to prepare for (flooding, drought), market opportunities and new techniques which can improve their productivity. They could then provide feedback on how successful certain innovations were, or propose their own proven technique for others to learn from and use.

Powerful information, conveyed clearly, to improve the lives of some of the poorest people in the world and their environment; this is what we do. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we discover what is possible.
