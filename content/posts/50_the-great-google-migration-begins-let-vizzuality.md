The Great Google Migration Begins: Let Vizzuality be your guide
===============================================================

![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/511040e312f1ffb60b1bf4569ec12a01/tumblr_inline_nihunycPPz1t4iqzu.png)

<span>At Vizzuality we have always worked with people that do important
things with maps. Working with United Nations, the World Bank, World
Resources Institute, Google and a host of non-profits we have seen first
hand the power and impact maps can deliver.</span>

Since the advent of Google Maps Engine, lots of organisations have used
it - from USGS to UNEP, National Geographic to NASA. However, today
Google announced the depreciation of Google Maps Engine which for some
might leave them in a difficult position. Keen to make sure they can
continue to deliver splendid impact to the world, we are offering our
services to help transfer over your GME account to CartoDB.

From Google to CartoDB
