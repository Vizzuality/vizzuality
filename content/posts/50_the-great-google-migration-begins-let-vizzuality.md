At Vizzuality we have always worked with people that do important things with maps. Working with United Nations, the World Bank, World Resources Institute, Google and a host of non-profits we have seen first hand the power and impact maps can deliver.

Since the advent of Google Maps Engine, lots of organisations have used it - from USGS to UNEP, National Geographic to NASA. However, today Google announced the depreciation of Google Maps Engine which for some might leave them in a difficult position. Keen to make sure they can continue to deliver splendid impact to the world, we are offering our services to help transfer over your GME account to CartoDB.

From Google to CartoDB
