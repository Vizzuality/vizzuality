Vizzuality at FOSS4G
====================

![](http://2011.foss4g.org/sites/2011-test.foss4g.org/files/acquia_prosper_logo.jpg)One
mor year [FOSS4G](http://2011.foss4g.org/) is here. The most important
conference on Geospatial Open Source software will take place this year
at Denver, and we will be there. Actually big part of Vizzuality will be
there: [@saleiva](https://twitter.com/#!/saleiva/)
[@tokumin](https://twitter.com/#!/tokumin/)
[@xavijam](https://twitter.com/#!/xavijam/) and
[@jatorre](https://twitter.com/#!/jatorre/) 

This is a very important year for us. We will be presenting lots of new
developments that we have been working for a long time and that we will
be releasing. More specifically expect to hear from us about CartoDB and
CartoSet quite a lot.

We are presenting also quite a bit, look for these sessions to learn
about our projects and Open Source Products.

1.  [Techniques for distributed high-speed map tile generation using
    Mapnik & Node.js](http://2011.foss4g.org/program/sessions?page=1):
    [@tokumin](https://twitter.com/#!/tokumin) will show CartoDB
    internals and introduce the new Open Source project.
2.  [CartoSet, a new FOSS to create highly visual geo
    portals](http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/cartoset-new-foss-create-highly-visual-geo-portals):
    [@jatorre](https://twitter.com/#!/jatorre/) will develop a full site
    using the new CartoSet Framework. Good luck with the demo effect!\
    \
3.   [Map design, usability and
    interaction](http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/map-design-usability-and-interaction): The
    geospatial world lacks of design, usability and interaction, learn
    from our lead UX designer,
    [@saleiva](https://twitter.com/#!/saleiva/), how to rock with maps.\
    \
4.  [HTML5 for Rich Geospatial applications on the
    web](http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/html5-rich-geospatial-applications-web):
     We have been working quite a lot recently on HTML5 and new web
    apps. [@xavijam](https://twitter.com/#!/xavijam) will show you lot
    of experiments using canvas or how to structure an entire
    application demoing [GeoCAT](http://geocat.kew.org/).

![](http://images.vrbo.com/vrbo/images/183e61)

We are very excited to participate and attend the great presentations we
see in the program.

Finally we will be staying in a nice penthouse downtown with the good
people from UNEP-WCMC. We will probably be hacking one day during the
week on CartoSet and CartoDB for environmental datasets. If you feel
like joining us let us know!

Looking forward to meet everybody!
