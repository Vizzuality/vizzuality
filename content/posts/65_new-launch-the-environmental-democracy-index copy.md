Vizzuality is delighted to announce our latest tool: the <a href="http://www.environmentaldemocracyindex.org">Environmental Democracy Index!</a> It was launched to the world with aplomb earlier today through a live web-stream by our friends at WRI and TAI.

Vizzuality love working with open data; getting data in front of lots of people helps increase transparency, initiating discussions around tackling the biggest issues in the world today. The EDI website allows you to freely and easily analyse the data at all levels, comparing the situation within a country or between two or three different countries. You can then share your findings on Facebook or Twitter and can continue the conversation with your networks.

Getting the data out there is great but, to command the attention this important issue deserves, you need a fast, interactive and captivating application. The EDI contains a lot of data. We created an intelligent architecture that places the most important information up top, then reveals greater detail when you find a topic you want to analyse more deeply.

The application then needs a clean, simple design with plenty of interactivity and visual rewards to attract and engage viewers. By removing all the technological, design and access barriers, the EDI website makes the data truly transparent.

[Daniel Caso](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/daniel_caso) led the design of the front end of this project, which was deployed expertly by [David Inga](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/david_inga), [Clara Linos](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/clara_linos) and [Andres Gonzalez](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/andres_gonzalez), while [Alicia Arenzana](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/alicia_arenzana) worked on the data management side.

Itâ€™s been fantastic to work with WRI again, after our successful collaboration to create [Global Forest Watch](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/globalforestwatch). They did a great job of pulling together a comprehensive dataset, creating the indicators for us to visualise and providing us feedback on early versions of the application. With the user-friendly CMS system we built, Jesse and the team at WRI can manage and update all the information on the site, so keep looking for the latest data releases. 

We are very excited to be part of this movement and look forward to seeing how it will be used to improve environmental democracy across the world.
