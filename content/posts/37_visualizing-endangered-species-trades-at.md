Visualizing endangered species trades at EcoHackNYC
===================================================

We spent yersterday’s Earth Day at our offices in NYC trying to do
balloon mapping, a nice way to end an intense
[EcoHackNYC](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/#program) weekend. It is the
second time we co-organized this (un)conference. Last fall we gathered
at NYU and this time we met at Parsons. 

The event started Friday with a series of 5-minute ignite talks. On
Saturday, we divided in small groups and worked on solutions. Here is a
sample of some of our favorite geospatial projects. 

### Visualizing Species Trading

A five-team group, including three from Vizzuality, worked with a big
and interesting dataset of 12 million endangered species trades, to
create an interactive visualization called the [Species
Sphere](http://saleiva.github.com/EcoHack2012/#). All data is fetched
from CartoDB and visualized using d3.js. Amazing work done in just 8
hours!

### Improving the creation of Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA)

Another group worked on a simple map interface to communicate local
demand for community-supported agriculture (CSA). The
[project](http://csabuilder.herokuapp.com/) is built on Heroku for
hosting, MapBox for map tiles, Leaflet for the mapping interface, and
jQuery with CartoDB for all the analysis.

### Visualizing deforestation

Check too this [map of global forest
height](http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/villeda.simard-forests.html#5.00/-7.019/-58.013)
showing deforestation in the Amazon, build at the EcoHack:

### We weren’t there alone

This time we also expanded the meeting beyond data and code and we
teamed up with [The Public
Laboratory](http://publiclaboratory.org/es/node/1) to add a
hardware-hacking to the event. The Public Laboratory has developed a
balloon mapping kit that enables you to collect your own aerial photos
from up to 1000 ft. Using the open source MapKnitter web-based software,
you can stitch the resulting images into a web-viewable map.  

The [Air Quality
Egg](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edborden/air-quality-egg) team
brought also their DYI sensor-box for real-time air column monitoring.
It was customized and added to the balloon kit to gain additional
capabilities. The system contains sensors to read NO2, CO, temperature,
humidity, compass (to calculate wind direction), wind speed, dust
(particulate matter), VOC’s, altitude, as well as O3, and streams the
data in real-time via XBee to Pachube.com.

It was a great, brilliant event. We are looking forward to the next one!
