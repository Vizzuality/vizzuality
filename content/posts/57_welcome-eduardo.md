Joining our growing lineup of designers, Vizzuality is very proud to welcome [Eduardo Villuendas](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/eduardo_villuendas) to the team. After studying in Elisava University in Barcelona, Eduardo has been a prolific designer over the last 8 years. In that time he has worked for clients such as El Corte Inglés, Real Madrid or Ediciones SM, designing cutting edge interfaces for websites, tools and applications.

Eduardo’s most valued treasures are a NASA t-shirt purchased in Cape Canaveral and his video game soundtrack collection. He really loves to watch movies and travel to distant places, although he insists his greatest but most unnoticed achievement is his [Instagram profile](http://instagram.com/mrheston).
