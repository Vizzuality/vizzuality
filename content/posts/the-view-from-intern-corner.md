In the Cambridge office, we have started the process for selecting an intern to work with us over the summer. We took this opportunity to talk with Clément Prod’homme, who has been interning with the Madrid team for nearly 3 months now, to see how his placement is going. These are his first impressions of his time with Vizzuality so far.

I like to see Dani working through the process of finding a good design for a project. He starts from a lot of basic ideas, basic elements such as shapes, and creates really attractive designs with Eduardo. I’m really interested in design, even if I don’t have the skills yet.

I’m working on a project called Tocapu, which basically helps people understand their data by making charts from their CartoDB account. About one month ago, when I started the project, it was in an initial state (it still is). Because I’m the only developer, this helps me to understand every layer of the web development process. I really enjoy working with David Inga: he often lets me figure out solutions for issues by myself and is good at giving me ideas, not telling me what to do. At the beginning I felt a bit lost, but now I feel like I’m really improving my skills, picking up good practices and learning about why different tools should be developed in certain ways.

As an intern, I feel like I can make mistakes without fearing the consequences and that people around me are supportive and will help me find a solution. I don’t feel like a separate part of the team as I work (with the others) on big projects and can have sometimes “big” responsibilities. I really appreciate the confidence people give me at work.
