We are very pleased to introduce [Simão Belchior](http://www.vizzuality.com/team/simao_belchior) to Vizzuality as a Product Developer. He’ll bring a continental blend of back-end development, agile management and business development to the Cambridge office. Already in his short time at the company he has helped us develop visualisations for [Google](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/google_trends) and has started work on some exciting new projects (keep an eye on this blog for announcements).

Simão can speak in Portuguese, English, Spanish, Ruby and gif. He came to Cambridge to work with the United Nations Environment Programme, first as a developer then as an analyst developer, building and managing large data projects related to species. Simão has now spent 5 years living in Cambridge and is a founding member of the Cambridge Ruby User Group as well as a keen footballer.
