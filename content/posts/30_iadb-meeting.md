Presenting on Open Data for Sustainable Tourism with Inter-American Development Bank  
======================================================================================

![](http://vizzuality.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/mictting.png)Today we
presented at [MICTTing](http://www.mictting.com/) in Punta del Este,
Uruguay, talking about how open data and open source can be leveraged
for sustainable tourism programs.

Eric Gundersen from Development Seed joined us on the panel and
presented on the open source mapping platform
[TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) and Javier presented on [Open
Data, environment](http://www.slideshare.net/jatorre/javier-de-latorre)
and [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/). The balance was great. There is a
few companies out there that share the same vision as we do, and
Development Seed is one of them. They are the authors of some really
[cool projects](http://developmentseed.org/projects/) and pretty
[amazing technology](http://mapbox.com/). They also are an open source
company and we have been following some of their creations code for a
while in CartoDB. This exemplifies to its best, the great outcomes that
can happen between small companies supporting open source and
innovation.

Our collaboration extends well beyond the stage. Additionally,
Development Seed and Vizzuality are talking a lot about future joint
workshops, sharing projects, ideas and in general closer relations
between the companies as we both work to push open source in the
development and environmental space. We can not be more happy to be so
close to such a talented company and we are sure we will all have lot of
fun in the future.
