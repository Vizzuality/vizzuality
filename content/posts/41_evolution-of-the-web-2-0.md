Evolution of the Web 2.0
========================

Two weeks ago we launched <span class="s1">[The Evolution of the
Web](http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com)</span>, a revamped, dynamic
visualization of the history of web technologies and browsers, and the
growth of global internet users and traffic since the early nineties.
This work was done in collaboration with the Google Chrome team and
Hyperakt. The Evolution of the Web project launched for the first time
in 2011 has grown and improved with each version.

*The web today is a growing universe of interlinked web pages and web
apps, teeming with videos, photos, and interactive content. What the
average user doesn’t see is the interplay of web technologies and
browsers that makes all this possible.* *–  Evolution of the Web 2.0*

The Evolution of the Web uses a timeline to illustrate the interaction
between web technologies and how they’ve evolved. The visualization
highlights how each new technology has given web developers the ability
to create “new generations of useful and immersive web experiences” from
1991 through present day. 

The site is available in 14 languages, and includes some major changes
from the 2011 version. The main goal in this release was to update and
enrich the data included in the visualization while making it much more
dynamic and interactive. If you are viewing the site online, you can
click on any web technology or milestone and a color band is highlighted
to indicate when the technology or milestone was achieved across each
browser. There are also day and night modes (to turn the background
white or black), panning, and zooming functionalities. We’ve used CSS3
and the javascript library, D3, to build the new site, including the new
3D look. 

The visualization is made with vector shapes and it is mobile and
tablet-ready for Android and iOS. There’s also a brand new visualization
included that shows the growth of internet –both global internet users
and global internet traffic. 

The result is an appealing, responsive visualization of the technologies
that make browsing the internet a great experience. If you have attended
the Google I/O conference for developers (June 26-29, San Francisco),
you may have seen it projected on the big screen on [Day 2 of the
keynote](https://developers.google.com/events/io/). Otherwise, you can
experience it at

viewed on Chrome 19+, Firefox 13+, Safari 5+, Opera 11+, or Internet
Explorer 9+), or read a full description of the project here:
