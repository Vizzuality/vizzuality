Visualized: How to discover a planet
====================================

We had a great time last week at
[Visualized](http://visualized.com/agenda.php), a two-day conference
exploring the evolution of communication at the intersection of big
data, storytelling and design. 

Javier de la Torre, Vizzuality’s CEO, was one of the “storytellers”
invited to present new ideas on how to make a bigger impact when
visually sharing data-driven stories, whether it is for personal use,
business, education, or social innovation. 

[![](http://cartodb.s3.amazonaws.com/tumblr/posts/visual.png)](http://visualized.com/)

Javier took the stage for 20 minutes to talk about [Planet
Hunters](http://www.planethunters.org/) and other projects crowdsourcing
data to annotate millions of records, and build compelling stories that
connect with audiences. You can check and download
the [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/jatorre/how-to-discover-a-planet) here. 

Visualized is an inspiring gathering, and we were delighted to
participate. Thanks to the organizers for the invitation.
