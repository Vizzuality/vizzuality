Gerardo started making websites at a very young age (when those MSN groups were still around and cool.) Even then, he knew he wanted to pursue that passion professionally. Since then he has moved to another country, gotten a degree in computer applications development and now lives happily in sunny Madrid, where he continues to grow his professional career as a front-end developer. 

He joined Vizzuality in January 2015 eager to keep learning and making awesome products.
