Clément is an intern with the front end engineering team. Born in Angers, France, he is studying Computer Science at the Grenoble Institute of Technology. Last year he got the opportunity to go to Madrid on an Erasmus exchange and hasn’t looked back since. He is looking forward to learning about the technologies and processes for building client-side dynamic web applications. 

A former swimmer, Clément now prefers cooking at home, and can make delicious pastries from scratch. We’re all looking forward to sampling his culinary delights over the next few months, as well as seeing what applications he can cook up during the internship.
