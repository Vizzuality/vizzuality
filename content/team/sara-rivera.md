Sara is a designer who believes in honest, clear and functional design. Her passion for design was first sparked by an art and design course at Central Saint Martins, London at the age of 17 and it led her towards a degree in advertising and PR, and a Masters in interface design at Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca. Sara loves the problem solving aspects of design and is always picking up new knowledge that she can put to use in her work. 

Before joining us, Sara was the only designer at ElParking, a startup in Salamanca. She designed user interfaces for mobile and desktop and managed the companyâ€™s branding and graphic design. After working alone for a year, Sara is happy to be part of larger team of designers who enjoy working together and learning from each other.

Outside of work, Sara can often be found watching Stranger Things or German Expressionist cinema, a genre she became fascinated with when she studied its themes of architecture, art and society.
