Craig is CEO of Vizzuality.  He is responsible for figuring out what problems we should be trying to solve. Before joining Vizzuality, he spent 7 years working with the UN Environment Programme running technology projects across the world and the previous 7 years with the UK government undertaking marine geospatial research. His lucky number is 7. 

Craig has seen first hand the power of combining elegant design with technology and science to help solve really very difficult challenges. He has however been unsuccessful at importing “builders tea” to our Spain office.
