Alejandro Moscoso is a designer at Vizzuality. Having recently completed a degree in Graphic Design at the Universidad Europea de Madrid, freelancing along the way with some digital design studios, he’s now ready for the real action to begin. 

Alex’s skills lie in visual and interaction design for a range of devices, but works across the whole process from prototypes right upto the final design. He’s also a bit of a coder as well and is always looking newest methods in web design, development and strategy. Alex is a fanatic of good stories, mainly from classical novels and cinema d'auteur: we’re all looking forward to indie cinema nights in the office over the next few months!
