 José Hernández is Vizzuality's in-house video and motion graphics expert. Motion Graphics are one of the most effective means of communication and José’s work ensures our products can convey information clearly on a number of devices. He has trained as a graphic designer over the last few years, surfing the flash wave before moving into video filming and motion graphics design. He still starts each project with a hand-drawn storyboard, but the end products combine cutting edge technologies.
