Tomas is a front end engineer who specialises in interaction design. He enjoys working on technical challenges which lead to fun user interfaces that help people learn about our world. Before joining Vizzuality, Tomas was a freelance engineer for an American company and a full stack engineer for a mobile health tracking app. Today, he’s tracking the health of our planet. 

Tomas is the first Swede to join our team. After studying art and interaction design in his small hometown, Nässjo, he moved to the bright lights of Stockholm, then Madrid. When Tomas needs to clear his head he’ll make a trip to the movies and watch a fantasy film or a drama. Like many of our talented teammates, Tomas enjoys a jam and plays blues rock with his friends.
