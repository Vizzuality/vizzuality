Kamil is a front-end developer who uses his knowledge of React and Redux to translate our designs into code. He loves the feeling that comes with knowing he’s part of a bigger mission to make people more aware of climate change and its effects. With that in mind, Kamil’s dedicated to creating experiences that will inform and inspire everyone to do more for our planet. 

Before joining our team, Kamil worked for woodpecker.co and studied at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology. He moved from Poland to Porto to be with us and is now enjoying the warmer winters. When he’s not working, Kamil enjoys cooking up delicious feasts out of nothing and sharing his creations with close friends.
