Ronny joins us as our Data Analyst Intern as he prepares to undertake a masters in Data Science here in Madrid. Ronny understands that there is much we can discover through data and gets excited when he thinks about what people could achieve if we were able to access all the data we generate. With this in mind, he’ll be diving into the data to discover insights that will help us make the world a better place.

Ronny is passionate about football, travelling, and food. He’d like to be a contestant on MasterChef one day!
