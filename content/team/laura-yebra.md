Laura is Vizzuality's Financial Controller. She joins us after three years working in accounting for a number of retail, renewable energy and telecommunications companies. With a masters in International Management from the prestigious IE Business School, a keen eye for visualising data and a love of working in sectors that make a difference to the world, Laura is the perfect person to perform this essential role as we continue to grow in the next few years. 

Outside Vizzuality Laura might be found trekking across the mountain landscapes outside Madrid (as long as it’s not too hot) or around El Bierzo in Northern Spain. She’s also eager to try new recipes, so the Vizzuality Kitchen should soon be full of sweet treats and delicious smells. Laura also aims to get the team visiting the bars of Madrid to find new bands or heading to the arenas to see Bruce Springsteen or U2 when they next come to town.
