Agnieszka is a developer with magic powers in Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. She takes an iterative approach to writing code: writing it, deleting it, then replacing it with better code until she’s satisfied it’s up to scratch. She’ll help you do it too if you ask. 

Born in Kraków, Poland, Agnieszka’s first attempt at programming was telling the Logo turtle to draw a star on Schneider CPC6128 machine. Later on she decided to make software engineering her career and studied for an MSc in Computer Science at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, specialising in Software and Database Systems Engineering. In the five years prior to joining us, Agnieszka built databases and websites at UNEP-WCMC that helped governments and NGOs tackle important environmental issues such as illegal wildlife trade. 

At the end of a long day of coding and keeping up with her kids, Agnieszka loves nothing more than curling up with a good book.
