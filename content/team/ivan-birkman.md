Ivan is a back-end developer who loves being a part of a creative team and seeing his work come to life. Born and raised in Brazil, Ivan has always been obsessed with games, consoles and computers. Therefore, when he decided to study at Dev Bootcamp, it was the perfect opportunity to start using his passion for the benefit of other people. With lots of experience in maintaining and developing microservices with ruby on rails, Ivan is learning to flex his muscles in the front end too. 

Naturally, Ivan loves to play video games when he’s kicking back and relaxing, but he also makes time for his other passion in life—Japanese cars.
