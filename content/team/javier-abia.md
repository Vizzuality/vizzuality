Javier is a front end developer who swapped trowels and brushes for keyboards and software after working as a field archaeologist for six years. It was during his search for the holy grail in GIS software and web mapping tools that Javier found himself entering the world of data visualisation. Today, Javier is equipped with knowledge of JavaScript(ES6), HTML5, CSS3 and Ruby on Rails; and powered by a determination to make data easier for humans to consume.
 
Hailing from Galicia, Javier keeps pushing his coding abilities to the next level. His pet project is the development of tools that professional archaeologists can use to make their data more accessible to other people. When heâ€™s not coding or learning, Javier loves to dance with his baby son.
