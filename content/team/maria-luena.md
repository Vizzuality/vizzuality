María is a front end developer with experience in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SAAS and React. She joined us after graduating from Adalab, a bootcamp that aims to reduce the gender gap within the technology sector. Fascinated by all of our projects, María is focused on developing delightful interfaces with React and Redux. 

Each of the roles María had before joining us required exceptional organisational skills. Her studies in telecommunication engineering led her into TV and Radio broadcasting where she had to balance all the people and inputs that go into a programme. Later on, while living in London for almost five years, María learnt how to expertly deliver quality products on time when working for Mars Retail in Logistics and Quality Assurance.

A keen traveller, María enjoys discovering new ways of living and thinking.
