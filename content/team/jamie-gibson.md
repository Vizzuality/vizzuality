 Jamie is Vizzualityâ€™s social scientist, and tries to work out how people think about the world around them, so that the things we build fit into their daily lives. Before Vizzuality, Jamie spent two years working with the United Nations Environment Programme, looking into the different ways governments collect and manage their environmental data. 
 In this time Jamie has seen the power of visualisations and tools to simplify the massive complexity of our environment so that people can make decisions to safeguard our planet. Jamie also helped to increase the average hair length of Vizzuality staff by a couple of inches.
