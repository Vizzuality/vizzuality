Iker is a Data Scientist who uses his scientific skills to analyse and interpret data, identifying the best approaches for addressing the issues we face. A Physicist at heart, Iker has always been interested in understanding the world around him. Before Vizzuality, he worked on research problems connected to Solar Physics, studying the interaction between the Sun’s plasma and magnetic fields to better understand the heating of the solar atmosphere. He applies the techniques he used, such as Deep Learning methods, to the research we do and seeks to understand the interaction of living species, climate, weather, and natural resources that affect life on earth.
