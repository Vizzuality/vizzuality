Adam joined Vizzuality as a developer in 2015. With a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and 2 and a half years of experience building web applications with the UN Environment Programme, he has a great deal of experience to add to the company. 
His skills in Ruby, Javascript and PostgreSQL will be of great use for projects like Global Forest Watch. When he’s not hacking software, you’ll find him playing around with laser cutters, arc welders and any other dangerous tools he can get his hands on.
