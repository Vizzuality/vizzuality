Raised in Alicante, Hector is interning with us as a front end engineer and designer. He has qualifications in multimedia engineering and a masters in graphic design, making him a bit of a rare species. Hector loves thinking about the interactions we use to bring maps to life and how to make them really simple for people to use. 

When he’s not building websites or designing his own range of keyrings, mugs and pillows, Hector can be found listening to music, playing tennis or snuggling with his two rabbits, Cake and Bola.
