After some years studying Architecture at ’Universidad Politécnica de Madrid’ and some more years working as an architect, always interested in new technology and visual communication, Clara decided to research new paths and started to study web development by herself. 

She joined Vizzuality as a front-end developer where she is very glad, always learning and developing websites that visualise data in new and exciting ways.
