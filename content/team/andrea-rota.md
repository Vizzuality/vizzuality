Andrea is an expert on infrastructure, APIs and data flows, helping us ensure that every one of our projects is built on a strong foundation. Before he joined our team, Andrea was managing web projects at the London School of Economics, teaching at King’s College London, and working as a consultant on web development, web archival and infrastructure projects. 

Andrea loves learning new programming languages and frameworks. He tests new ideas by tinkering with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi, often making tiny projects for home automation that are free of the privacy issues typically associated with commercial IoT cloud services. Andrea’s interest in privacy powered his academic studies and he holds a PhD in Sociology that focuses on hackers, users of free software, and privacy-oriented alternatives to social media platforms. 

Andrea’s favourite way to spend his downtime is with his young family. Whenever they can, they hop on their bikes and take a ride to one of their favourite spots.
