Álvaro is a blues playing, full-stack developer who creates flawless visuals with Ruby on Rails and React. He mostly plays in the frontend but likes to riff in the backend too, creating soulful user experiences and quality code. Álvaro’s motivated by a desire to make data more transparent and inspire people to defend the future of our planet. He has a degree in Communication and Media and studied at Le Wagon’s Ruby on Rails bootcamp in Brussels. 

Álvaro’s passion in life is music. For eight years he sang and played guitar with a blues band that played all over Spain. On stage he used his music to connect with the audience. Creating connections with humans remains a key principle in his work as a developer - striking the right chord that reverberates to the core.
