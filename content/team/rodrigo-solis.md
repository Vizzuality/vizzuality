Rodrigo is our front end developer intern and he joined us after completing a software engineering degree at Technical University Madrid. He’s developing his skills in React.js, Redux and Sass as he works on a variety of projects. Rodrigo likes software engineering because you are free to build anything you can imagine—creativity is your only constraint. He’s also fascinated by ways in which software is changing services that once seemed defined, like taxi services and the hospitality industry. 

A huge football fan, Rodrigo religiously watches all the Real Madrid and Mexico national team games. He’s also a jazz enthusiast who loves to travel and learn about new places.
