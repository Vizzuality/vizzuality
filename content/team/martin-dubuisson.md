Martin is a User Researcher who acts as an ambassador for the current and future users of Vizzuality’s creations. He ensures their needs and perspectives are properly listened to, translated and adequately addressed in the designs we produce. To do this, he conducts exploratory research with users and undertakes user testing and monitoring. 

Born in Belgium but raised in France, Martin is confidently fluent in French, English and Spanish. He studied Human Geography and Anthropology at University College Utrecht before doing a Research Masters in Sociocultural Anthropology at Utrecht University. Martin’s studies, fieldwork and Design Researcher experience have taught him to consider each point of view as singular yet intrinsically shaped by bigger cultural and economic forces.
