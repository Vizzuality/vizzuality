In her role as Human-Computer Interaction Researcher, Melanie aims to understand the psychology behind effective data visualisation and how we can make better, more impactful visualisations. To do this, she’s reviewing research into the visualisation of data relating to sustainability, reviewing industry practice, and conducting user tests with the support of our partners in the Department of Psychology at Cambridge University. Melanie’s position with us is made possible through the Knowledge Transfer Partnerships scheme managed by Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency. 

Melanie has two degrees in Psychology and recently submitted her PhD in Human-Computer Interaction to University College London. The research she undertook for her PhD focused on finding the best way to visualise residential energy data. Her current research allows Melanie to combine these academic interests and apply her knowledge to practical challenges that matter.

Since finishing her PhD, Melanie has been rediscovering her hobbies which include yoga, cycling, surfing, dogs, and doughnuts.
