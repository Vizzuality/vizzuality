Hailing from Chester in England, Ed is a front-end developer who loves delving into big data and mapping technologies. Ed’s experience includes working as a freelance web developer and developing video on-demand applications for web, mobile and consoles. He’s also done data analysis, using Python and PHP. At Durham University he studied for a Masters of Physics, specialising in theoretical astronomy and cosmology - which he describes as funky maths with meaning. Unsurprisingly, Ed takes great delight in star gazing and the moons of jupiter have never failed to impress him. 

Ed’s also a keen sportsman and depending on the season you’ll find him riding a snowboard or a bike. His dream is try out a monoski one day but right now the thought of the potential medical expenses is holding him back!
