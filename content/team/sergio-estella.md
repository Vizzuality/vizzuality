 Sergio is Head of Design at Vizzuality. Using his research into data visualization, information design and interface design, he sets the visual direction for many of our products. Sergio has always been interested in design and combined Interior Design studies with a Fine Arts degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. During his final year at University, Sergio started working as a web designer and art director.

 After studying design at the Colchester Institute he developed a further interest in interactive user experiences, information design and brand development. As a result he began writing about brands and their behavior in the early 2000â€™s and recently studied an Information and Acknowledge Society Master at UOC. Over the last decade time he has worked with different UN agencies, the World Resources Institute, CaLP, and ECHO to produce beautiful visualizations and intuitive user experiences.
