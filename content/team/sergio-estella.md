 Sergio is Head of Design and co-founded Vizzuality. Using his research into data visualization, information design and interface design, he sets the visual direction for many of our products. 

 Sergio has always been interested in design; he combined Interior Design studies with a Fine Arts degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. During his final year at University, Sergio started working as a web designer and art director.

 Studying design at the Colchester Institute piqued his interest in interactive user experiences, information design and brand development and has been writing about that since the early 2000s. He recently studied an Information and Knowledge Society Masters at UOC, but his most recent work has been the production of beautiful visualizations and intuitive user experiences.
