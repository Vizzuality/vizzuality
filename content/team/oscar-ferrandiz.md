Óscar is a frontend software developer with a passion for both pure programming in javascript and user interface development. From a young age, Óscar knew he wanted to work with web technologies. He studied computer science at Universidad Politécnica de Valencia and has worked in Valencia, Brussels and Madrid since he graduated six years ago. Today, Óscar develops awesome applications using javascript, HTML and CSS. 

Óscar is in love with the city of Valencia and plans to retire there one day. But, in the meantime he’s thrilled to be in Madrid working on high quality projects that push technology to new boundaries.
