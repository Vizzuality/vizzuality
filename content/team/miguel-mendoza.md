Miguel has been working full time at Vizzuality since 2014, following several years of fruitful collaboration, taking on back end set-up, databases and anything Ruby. Since the tender age of 12 he's been learning to code, from Basic and assembler to make video games to learning Pascal, Cobol, Fortran, C, DBase, javascript, Flash and now Ruby on Rails for all kinds of applications. His experimental multimedia installations were exhibited in the first International Festival of Art, Science and Technology.

Miguel's other great love is music; as well as a back end engineer he is a DJ and producer, mixing analog synths and electronics with his programming skills. If you can persuade him to leave Madrid and head for the coast, he'll also teach you how to dive!
