Estefanía’s role at Vizzuality is to create insightful, innovative and engaging experiences using data and her creative skills. Her work combines different styles with a strong eye on narrative, and she loves to experiment with new designs. 

Before joining Vizzuality, Estefanía worked at a digital agency that specialised in mobile apps. She has a degree in Advertising and Public Relations, and a Masters in Art Direction in Advertising but her education didn’t stop there. She’s taught herself motion and illustration, and attends courses on human-centered design that she puts into practice both at work and at home. 

In her spare time, Estefanía likes to get her hands dirty doing some gardening, crafting or pastry making. She’s a fan of zombie movies and video games too. Estefanía has a talent for capturing moments on film that usually pass without notice, and making them profound. She captures her street photography on an analogue camera and enjoys the anticipation of waiting to see if her shots have come out good or bad.
