Alex is the latest addition to our cohort of designers. He has a background in Industrial and Product design, which started with his undergraduate degree in Madrid and a masters degree in Milan. For the last few years he’s extended those skills further as a UI and visual designer for the mobile phone company Tuenti, which will be a great asset as we move towards more mobile first projects.

Alex is also an obsessive surfer and spends as much time as possible visiting the best beaches he can find, like Somo in Spain, Praia do Amado in Portugal and Hossegor in France.
