In her role as Design Researcher, Juliana uses a variety of investigation methods to gather insights about human behaviour that contribute to the problem-solving process. This allows Juliana to understand our users and help the team translate insights into actions that result in beautiful and useful products. 

Before joining us, Juliana had been working as research designer for four years, most recently at Ticketbis (Stubhub). She has a psychology degree from PUCRS, Brazil and studied innovation design at h2i institute. Juliana has two extra special loves in her life—her rescue cats Pixie and Txusca. When she isn’t with them or at work, she enjoys walking around the city taking photos of beautiful graffiti and people doing everyday things.
