 Adrián developed a keen interest in computers during his childhood, going on to study Software Engineering in Valladolid University. He started his first internship as a web developer there and after that started working for Spanish Government projects in Neoris, a software consultancy company.

 Two years later he had moved to Madrid and was developing the OKN Learning Suite, as well as building the UI for enterprises like Vodafone and Repsol. Eager to continue learning about front-end development he joined Vizzuality in 2014, where he develops and maintains Global Forest Watch, amongst other projects.

 Save the forest, please.
