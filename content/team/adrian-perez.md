 Adrián developed a keen interest in computers during his childhood, going on to study Software Engineering in Valladolid University. He started his first internship as a web developer there, and after that started working for Spanish Government projects in Neoris, a software consultancy company. 
 Two years after that he moved to Madrid and helped the development of the OKN Learning Suite, building the UI for enterprises like Vodafone and Repsol. Once this project ran by itself he was eager to continue his learning and gaining as more knowledge as he can about front-end development and joined Vizzuality, where he develops and maintains Global Forest Watch project. Save the forest, please.
