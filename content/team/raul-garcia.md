Raúl García is one of vizzuality;s full-stack developers. With his love of Javascript and a passion for learning something new everyday, he is a natural fit for the team and we're very excited to have him on board. 

Born in Segovia, Raul has a degree in Informatics and engingeering from the Complutense University of Madrid. A self-confessed barbeque lover, we’re looking forward to tasting some of his tasty grilled treats as the nights get lighter and the days get warmer! And if he’s not cooking or coding, he can immerse himself in Unix: his dog.
