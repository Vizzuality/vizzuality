Born and raised in Catalunya, María studied Environmental Science at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona before embarking on a Masters In Management at EADA, also in Barcelona. A cultural exchange programme in Japan gave María a chance to combine her love for travel and learning. It was here in the city of Nagoya that she first studied green finance and saw ways for European companies to learn from the Asian way of doing business.
