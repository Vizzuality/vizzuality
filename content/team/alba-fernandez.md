Alba Fernández works with us as a front-end developer. As well as qualifications in web application programming, Alba has qualifications in forest management and previously worked to protect and reforest the Regional Park of Guadarrama River. 

Alba is always on the lookout for something new. In the last year she’s taken up dancing Flamenco and playing the Cello, read countless books and hiked for kilometers in the forests and mountains around Madrid to find new landscapes to enjoy. We think Alba will be a natural fit at vizzuality!
