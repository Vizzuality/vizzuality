Tiago is a full-stack web developer from São João da Madeira, Portugal: he’ll be working on both front and back end applications for our projects. He’s been developing information systems since he graduated from Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto with a Masters in Computer Engineering. Before joining us, Tiago worked at GetSocial. 

Tiago is working on improving his Spanish skills and loves travelling and sports. If an injury prevents him from doing either, he’ll be found on a comfy sofa watching football.
