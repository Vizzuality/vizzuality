Hailing from Vienna, Austria, Manuela will join us for the next four months as an intern. Having recently completed a Master’s degree in Spatial Planning, Manuela has a wealth of knowledge of how humans use interactive maps to understand and communicate spatial relationships. She comes to vizzuality keen to build her skills in cartography and data visualisation and deepen her love affair with maps. We think she’ll fit right in here... 

If she’s not building maps you’ll probably find Manuela exploring new places, enjoying the ample Madridian sun or discovering great new music.
