Hailing from Vienna, Austria, Manuela will join us for the next four months as an intern. Having completed a Master’s degree in Spatial Planning, Manuela has a wealth of knowledge of how humans use interactive maps to understand and communicate about spatial relationships. 

Manuela’s spare time is devoted to exploring new places (especially sunny places) and discovering great new music.
