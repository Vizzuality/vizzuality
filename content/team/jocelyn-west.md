As our Community Manager, Jocelyn brings together thoughtful, creative, passionate people around data- and design-driven storytelling. We love being part of a community that uses technology and creative thinking to change the world, and Jocelyn is testing new ways to help us make an even more valuable contribution to it. 

Based in Washington, DC, and a graduate of Brown University, Jocelyn has combined her science research experience with empathy and storytelling skills to make data a force for good. She has educated students in the Peruvian Amazon about conservation and the community; surveyed disaster response and resilience across Asia; and communicated development issues to a global audience. She loves attending mapathons and volunteers in her local community to support people preparing for U.S. citizenship interviews.

Jocelyn would be delighted to talk with you about design, data, storytelling and anything else that sparks your curiosity. Maybe you’d like some tips on the best places in DC to go running, get inspired, or learn something new? Jocelyn probably knows them all. Get in touch and let her know how you’d like to get involved with our global community.
