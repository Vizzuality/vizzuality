Ewa is our Discovery and Research Intern and first bona fide film historian. Fresh out of University after completing a PhD on the Los Angeles’ film culture, Ewa is keen to learn how mapping could benefit the academic research in the areas of spatial humanities, post-humanities and critical cartography in her native Poland. Ewa is working on discovery and research, while making the most of the opportunity to learn about programming and designing. 

When she’s not working Ewa enjoys embroidery and boxing. This might seem like a strange combination, but both of these activities require focus and precision, skills she will get to use during her internship.
