As a kid Erik was obsessed with maps so it seems only natural that he’s made a career for himself developing beautiful, meaningful maps. He joins vizzuality as a front-end engineer, building applications that turn complex problems and datasets into stories that are accessible to everybody. 

Born near Paris, Erik studied at Gobelins where he focused on designing user experiences as a technologist on an applied arts course. After graduating, he was a freelance developer for five years which allowed him to dabble with technologies and medias like Unity3D, Arduino, mobile, web, touch screens, and augmented reality. Name anything else and he’s probably tried it at least once. Before joining us, Erik developed maps for data journalism pieces at CartoDB.

Erik’s three main passions in life are mapping, coding and eating but if he’s not doing any of those three, you’ll probably find him running in the mountains or practising his baritone singing. Back in Paris he was part of a gospel choir and he’d like to join one in Madrid if the opportunity arises.
