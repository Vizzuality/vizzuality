Camellia is vizzuality's lead writer. It's her job to raise the level of debate about digital products to improve our world through all of vizzuality’s communications. Camellia has been giving a voice to the species and ecosystems we all depend on to survive for nearly five years now. From the smallest fish in the Great Barrier Reef to the tapirs of the Amazon, she’s worked to inspire sustainable behaviour in the public and policy-makers by communicating high-quality science. With a masters in Conservation and Biodiversity to boot, 

If she’s not talking about them, you’ll find Camellia out and about in the sunny countryside, snapping pics for her carefully collated instagram. Just look at this cute picture of a field mouse she took on her first data at vizzuality! #blessed. Rumour has it her spirit animal is Channing Tatum.
