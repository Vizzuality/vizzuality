Adam is a Back-End Developer Intern who’s putting his problem-solving and communication skills to good use on projects that are important to the world. Formerly an A-level Physics Teacher, Adam decided that teaching teenagers wasn’t challenging enough for him, and dived into the exciting world of software engineering. Right now he’s part of our API team but Adam has his sights set on the full stack. He loves nothing more than studying an abstract topic, assessing it, and finding new ways to approach it—so the ever-evolving world of engineering is perfect for him. 

Hailing from Cheshire, England, Adam claims to be good at rapping but if you want to know if that’s true or not, you’ll have to ask for a demo.
