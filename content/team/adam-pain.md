Adam is a Data Scientist and back-end developer. He loves nothing more than studying an abstract topic, assessing it, and finding new ways to approach it—so the ever-evolving world of engineering is perfect for him. Formerly an A-level Physics Teacher, Adam decided that teaching teenagers wasn’t challenging enough for him, and dived into the exciting world of software engineering. He joined Vizzuality as an intern and impressed us with his problem-solving and communication skills. Today, Adam continues to curate data that’s important for the world, seeking out newer, better ways to visualise it.

Hailing from Cheshire, England, Adam claims to be good at rapping but if you want to know if that’s true or not, you’ll have to ask for a demo.
