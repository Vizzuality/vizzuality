Pablo has three obsessions in life: design, soccer and snowboards. Luckily for us, he’s chosen to put that passion into delivering meaningful digital products and services for all of our awesome clients. For 14 years Pablo focused on designs for the financial and media industries but now he’s turned his attention to data design that delivers social impact. 

Pablo loves to test prototype tools as it keeps him fresh and thoughtful, and he never lets a challenge defeat him. A native of Madrid, Pablo studied in the city and has a Master in Total Design from IED Istituto Europeo di Design, and a Degree in Information Science from UCM Universidad Complutense.
