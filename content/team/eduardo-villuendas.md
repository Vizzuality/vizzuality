 Eduardo studied Graphic Design in Elisava, Barcelona, and later worked as interface designer in a small startup and a marketing agency. He then moved to Madrid to work for  renowned design consultancy ‘The Cocktail’, and joined Vizzuality in January 2015. 
 His most valued treasures are a NASA t-shirt purchased in Cape Canaveral and his video game soundtrack collection. He really loves to watch movies and travel to distant places. He also loves clichés.
