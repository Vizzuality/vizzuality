 Eduardo is our third designer at Vizzuality. He studied Graphic Design in Elisava, Barcelona, before working as interface designer in a small startup and a marketing agency. He then moved to Madrid to work for renowned design consultancy ‘The Cocktail’ and joined Vizzuality in January 2015. 

 His most valued treasures are a NASA t-shirt purchased in Cape Canaveral and his video game soundtrack collection. He really loves to watch movies and travel to distant places. He also loves clichés.
