José Angel is a front end engineer with a specialism in HTML, CSS and Javascript. While studying a degree in Electronics and Automation, José discovered a love of web development and has followed that passion ever since. That passion brought him to Madrid this summer, and now to Vizzuality.

José likes to play sports, whether that’s a physical match or playing Fifa on our couch after work. His English is steadily improving thanks to shows like Lost, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, but he’s not a big fan of cats.
