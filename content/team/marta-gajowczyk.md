Marta is a front-end engineer working in our Porto office. Following her degree in Computer Science from Politechnika Wroclawska she spent some time working as a Full Stack Developer for Monterail in Wroclaw. Marta is excited to work with us, not only to build her skills in React but to work on projects that are positive for our planet. 

A native of Poland, now Marta lives in Porto with Homer, her beautiful Golden Retriever. Sheâ€™s looking forward to adding surfing to her already extensive list of hobbies: sport, food, photography and finding great new electronic music.
