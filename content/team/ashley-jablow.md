Ashley is Vice President, Development and Impact at vizzuality. In this role, Ashley partners with current and prospective clients to shape projects for success and to communicate the impact stories that matter most to them. As our first US-based hire, Ashley is also leading the creation of our third office in Washington, DC. Ashley joined vizzuality after a two-year stint as a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow, where she led human-centred design projects to improve the way government designs, builds, and delivers digital services to the public. Before that she worked in design thinking consulting and crowdsourcing for the OpenIDEO platform at IDEO.

Ashley sits at the place where people, technology and process meet. By engaging with and learning from the community we design for, Ashley helps them envision what success looks like and identify the best solution for reaching it.
