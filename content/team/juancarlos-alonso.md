Juan Carlos is a designer with 10 years experience of working in advertising in Madrid and Amsterdam. Originally from Benavente in northern Spain, Juan Carlos first came to Madrid to study at Escuela de Arte Nº10. He has experience in almost every step of the digital design and production process, from conceptualization and UX to coding large projects himself.

Juan Carlos is fascinated by monkeys and he hopes to see them in the wild one day. Being part of a team that helps save the forests that monkeys live in makes him really happy. Juan Carlos also uses his design skills to build beautiful furniture that is quality tested by his cat Bigotitos, whose name means ‘little whiskers’ in English.
