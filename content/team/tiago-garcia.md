 Tiago calls his relationship with computers and computer science “love at first sight”, which happened when he was only 9. He pursued this passion ever since, and finished his Master’s degree in Computer Science in Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia - UNL in Lisbon in late 2010. A few months after, he joined Vizzuality as a PHP backend developer. His other passions are gaming and music. Some believe he was born already wearing earphones.
